I'm Filip, one of the founders and tech leads of Inex One. I’ll be reviewing your application if you choose to apply 🙂 . Let's get it straight out of the way: you would be Engineer #7 in a team that also has two designers and one PM. In total, Inex One is made up of 17 colleagues, from Singapore to New York. Below you'll find detailed sections on what we think you should know about us before deciding to join us. This is pretty texty, so feel free to hop down to the sections that interest you most! #### The story of Inex One When my co-founders Max, Mehdi, Josefine and I started Inex One in Stockholm early 2018 we set out to improve global knowledge sharing. Knowledge (in the form of research reports, access to experts, data etc.) is still hard to come by: it’s expensive, siloed and hard to find. If you have ever wondered why management consultants exist this is one of the reasons - they have access to data that no one else has. The expert network industry is one of those industries that almost no one has heard of, but still has an enormous impact. In short it’s all about helping organizations get in contact with experts to provide insights and information. It is also an industry with huge margins, lots of inefficiencies and a pricing model (huge up-front contracts) that keeps smaller organizations out. This is where we decided to start. On the surface this might seem like a pretty dull industry. I strongly disagree, but never mind that, dull is a good place to be as a startup. The anonymous, dull and high margin parts of the B2B world is where a startup can succeed without giving away the entire company to VCs and without waiting 10 years for profitability. During the past three years we've helped organizations small and large come in contact with thousands of experts. We have a small and effective team that believes in working smarter, not harder. It's amazing what a small team of focused and capable individuals can accomplish through effective teamwork. We don't have many meetings, and most of our work happens asynchronously on GitHub and Slack. Everyone is included and can see every discussion or decision they want to contribute to. Right now I think Inex is really at a sweet spot. Small enough that every team member can have a significant impact. Large enough that we can offer a stable working environment, competitive salaries, solid project management and well defined tasks. Close to profitability, growing steadily with strong investor backing. We are now focused on growing into a stable and profitable company without additional external investment. #### The product Our product connects organizations doing research with expert networks that are specialized in finding experts in different fields and geographies. We support over 20 expert networks and hundreds of clients, doing dozens of expert calls every day. Our clients come in all shapes and sizes such as consultancies, corporates, PE funds and non-profits. We are proud to have clients on all continents except Antarctica (not yet!). There is a lot of work of the typical CRUD + notifications type on the platform. But we also have elements of recommendation algorithms, NLP (transcripts, summaries, sentiment analysis), browser plugins, search and our own conferencing system (built on top of Twilio). We try to be pragmatic about product management and we've learned a lot. In the beginning we thought we knew more than we did and spent a lot of time on the wrong things. Nowadays we take UX, planning and user interviews very seriously. For any larger tasks we create working groups consisting of UX, tech and business that shape a feature together before detailed designs and coding begin. We don’t adhere to any specific methodology, most seem geared towards larger companies, but have taken inspiration from agile and shape-up. #### Upcoming technical work * 50% creating larger features based on client or expert network needs. Some examples of upcoming projects are improved search, transcript summaries and better calendar management. * 20% smaller features. Often it's little product changes that can add lots of value. This often involves learning more about user needs in order to come up with the best and simplest solution. * 10% bug fixes, at most. Thanks to really solid CI, decent tests and consistent code written for readability and maintainability we have few bugs that are usually easy to fix. * 20% devOps, tech debt elimination and work on improving the developer experience. We prioritize ease of development very highly and have for the past year always had at least one team member focus on this. #### Requirements ##### Skills * 5+ years in software development * Experience of leading software development work * The ability to ship solid, testable and readable code (preferably React, Node & Typescript - but not a must, we know that good senior developers learn new languages and frameworks quickly anyway) * Understand how web apps work and have a good understanding of deployments, browsers, servers etc. * Effective written and verbal English * Able to communicate with other people on the project team effectively * bonus Experience with DevOps, search (such as Elastic), NLP, postgres, React, Node, Typescript ##### Personality * Eager to take ownership and lead the development of one of our product areas * Willing to learn, grow and work as a team * Believe that empathy and effective communication is important * Preference towards the simplest solution rather than the most technically interesting one * Pragmatic and able to make decisions with incomplete information, not afraid to ask for clarification * Strong sense of responsibility for upholding product stability and quality * After the first 6 months we expect you to * Have shipped several features * Be communicating effectively in the team * Be leading engineering decisions #### The codebase Our philosophy has always been to keep things simple and readable. The business we are in will never lead to huge traffic volumes so it’s better to focus on developer productivity, simplicity and security rather than optimizations, advanced infrastructure and microservices. The entire codebase is written in typescript with React+Node+Postgres. This was a very conscious choice because it allows code sharing and lets developers move seamlessly between the front and back end. This is great because it allows for more varied tasks and a deeper understanding of the system as a whole. Here are some points about how we do things currently * We release multiple times per week (merge to master = release) * We share lots of types and files between the frontend and the backend, since it's all typescript! * Monorepo setup using Yarn workspaces. Linting, code styling and type checking throughout the codebase. Everything is integrated with VSCode. * GitHub workflow. PRs close GitHub issues that we manage in a Kanban board. Every PR deploys a full working environment where backend and frontend can be accessed live. #### Remote work at Inex Inex is remote first, we are currently 6 developers living in 6 different countries. That means our processes are built for remote work from the get go. Code reviews, pair programming and joint planning sessions are built into the process. As are (very short) daily standups, retrospectives and times when we can share what we have built and learned. Still there is something that happens when you meet face to face, have a nice dinner and a beer or two. We make sure to have regular retreats together and visit each other. In November the entire team came to Paris to visit Mehdi. In the beginning of 2022 the whole company will come and visit me in Stockholm. The role is remote but we are currently open to candidates within 2 hours of our timezone (CET) in order to reduce issues with meeting times and synchronous collaboration. #### Some of the people at Inex Below is a selection of people at the company. I mention these five because I think they show that we know what we are doing. We have started companies before, we have been customers of and worked at expert networks. **Max Friberg**: Our CEO, previously a huge consumer of expert calls at McKinsey as well as a founder of an expert network. The guy behind our SEO (try googling “expert network”). https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxfriberg **Josefine Vinberg**: Our COO, with a background in tech product management and running a large tech team at Widespace. Sharp business thinker, and a champion of “doing one thing really really well”. https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvinberg/ **Filip Gruvstad**: Co-CTO, did a brief stint at McKinsey and also did some expert calls. Before Inex he’s been CTO & co-founder at 2 other marketplace startups (Yepstr is still alive and kicking). A fan of good food, techno and structured code! https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipgruvstad **Mehdi Rejraji**: Co-CTO, absolutely brilliant developer and previous co-founder and CTO at Airnum. A champion of remote-first work, and of our expert network partners. https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdirejraji **Ana Price**: Head of Product. Recently joined Inex to lead product management, after 8 years at the world’s largest expert network GLG. Ana is planning a number of exciting additions to the platform. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-price-16513978/ #### Here are some of the perks of the job * Ability to have an impact from day 1 * Fun, sharp and diverse set of colleagues * Freedom and responsibility to set your own schedule * Work from home (or from a co-working space) * Regular team retreats to fun locations * Low amount of time spent in meetings * Yearly budget for learning and development * Computer & phone setup of your choice * Financially stable company * Sizable equity compensation * Market rate salary compensation In the interest of transparency please consider xa0**these reasons not to join us**: * You prefer working in a “ticket factory” where each ticket is precisely defined, you do it and then you forget about it and move on. This is still a small company, you are expected to think for yourself: what could make this task better? What have we missed? etc. * You think more features and complex technology is the best way to solve all problems. * You want to spend all day writing complex algorithms and optimizing code to shave off the last millisecond. It does happen, but not often, problem solving for us is mostly about figuring out customer needs and trying to solve them in the cleanest most simple way possible.

But obesity treatment is radically changing due to a new wave of medication options which are 2-3x more effective than previous options. In addition, only 10% of those using weight management services are men: all programs market to women, not tackling the stigma men feel around this. Fella 's founders are Luke(https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-harries) & Richie(https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-cartwright). We studied together at Cambridge University.

Along with my business partner James, we’ve been on a mission to change the way people buy and sell online for over 8 years. We started Saily, the first app to buy & sell used stuff in 2012. We grew it to 500,000+ users before joining Mercari, the giant mobile marketplace. There we led Product & Growth and IPO’ed in 2018. Six months ago, we built Flyp, an app that connects small businesses to professional sellers who sell their clothing inventory for them. Pros handle pricing, listing, negotiating with buyers, packing and shipping each item, then splitting profits. We just started growing our backend team to develop tools to empower our resellers. These are web-based tools involving web scraping and Chrome extensions to enable cross-listing inventory & automating sales on websites like eBay & Poshmark. We’re looking to hire a third full-time backend engineer to be in charge of our tools (Node.js). We value attitude over skills.

We help people start and scale companies, get impactful jobs at companies, and invest in their careers.

As the Senior Product Marketing Manager, you'll be joining a small team of marketers on the Startups team driving market awareness of ODX, ODF and On Deck’s brand as the go-to place for founders and founders to be.

That’s why we’re looking for a creative, driven product marketer who can help us better understand founders, and use that knowledge to launch new products, tools, and features that generate net new entrepreneurship. Working closely with the Design, Brand and Marketing teams, you'll find, execute, and grow the next significant growth opportunities. **Who You’ll Work With** In this role, you’ll report to Gonz, the Head of Growth, Startups and work closely with the marketing team, the brand team and the Startups team.

You'll help create our company's culture. * We're an early-stage startup. Projects and priorities are likely to shift. * Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty ambitions.

We (**Ben(https://twitter.com/r00k)**, xa0**Spencer(https://twitter.com/spencercdixon)**, and xa0**Joel(https://twitter.com/robamaton)**) founded the company three years ago because we disliked pairing over Slack and Zoom. We believed that by focusing on remote pairing exclusively, we could create a tool that developers would actually like. Turns out we were right! We've grown to millions in revenue and tens of thousands of paid users in three years without any outside funding. Our product is used by the savvy engineers at companies like Shopify, Stripe, Spotify, and Netflix. (Want the latest on how things are going? Ben hosts xa0**a weekly podcast(https://artofproductpodcast.com/)** xa0where he shares regular updates.) ## xa0**Role overview** For the first 4 years of its life, Tuple was available only on macOS. However, our users kept requesting a Linux client (and we love making our users happy), so we decided to build one. Over the last year, we split the old app into a macOS-specific component and a cross-platform real-time communication engine (using customized WebRTC under the hood). Additionally, we've created a Linux version of our application (built atop the cross-platform engine) and launched a small alpha to early users. On March 1st, 2022, we hope to make the (now polished, reliable, and close to feature parity) Linux version of Tuple generally available. This project is currently owned by our CTO, with support from the rest of our 3-person Engineering team. We're looking for someone with significant Linux app development experience to join this project, make substantial contributions, and quickly take over primary responsiblity for development of the Linux client. This role reports to our CTO, xa0**Spencer(https://twitter.com/spencercdixon)**. ## xa0**Things you'll do a lot** - Collaborate with our Product Designer to turn mocked-up features into shipped code - Pair program with our other engineers to spread knowledge, foster connections, and make work more fun - Collaborate with folks in Success/QA to fix bugs affecting our customers - Use your hard-won wisdom to make savvy architectural decisions about the codebase - Provide feedback to our Product folks about how to make the app feel at home in the Linux ecosystem - Write tests for your code to prevent regressions ## xa0**Must-haves** - Warmth, kindness, and a willingness to pair program regularly (using Tuple, obvi) - Deep knowledge of C++ and C - Significant experience with UNIX/POSIX - A work day with 4+ hours of overlap with Boston's - Multiple years of experience building apps with GTK - Comfort debugging distro-specific issues (you probably have 5+ VMs on your machine already) - Comfort interfacing with X11 APIs ## xa0**Nice-to-haves** - Experience with PulseAudio APIs - Experience with GTKMM - Experience with OpenGL - Experience writing tests with Catch2 - Experience distributing Linux apps with Snap, Flatpak, or AppImages - Knowledge of the GNOME HIGs and an interest in building apps that are good citizens on the platforms they target - Upstream patches merged into GTK or GTKMM/other open source GTK app examples - You know what LFS is and maybe even completed it yourself - You've written your own widget toolkit and event loop on top of X11 for fun/education - You have a well groomed dotfiles system ## xa0**Why you might want to work with us** - We're quite small (fewer than 10 employees), so there are no layers of bureaucracy to work through. You can have a huge impact here. - We rarely have meetings and are very flexible on work schedules. - Our team is warm and friendly but highly productive. - You'll have a front-row seat at an early-stage, fast-growing company. If you hope to start your own thing someday, this could be good preparation. ## xa0**Why you might not want to work with us** - Tuple is a complicated app! There will be lots to learn before you can be truly productive. - While we host several in-person retreats per year, you'll spend most of your time working remotely. ## xa0**Salary** We're looking for someone great, not someone cheap. If you're expensive but amazing, we'll make it work. Be sure to mention the word **EBULLIENCE** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Fluent spoken and written English is required. **Employer**: abbywinters.com BV (warning, nudity), a company incorporated in the Netherlands. **Recruiting**: You'll be dealing directly with the business Owner, existing Sys Admin and the Lead Developer in the recruiting process. No recruiters, agencies, or middle-management. **Us**: We create and maintain web applications to support our ethical adult website business www.abbywinters.com (warning, nudity), running on our in-house software. Some web applications are customer-facing, some are for internal use only. We recruit models, make shoots, edit and release them. Customers are charged for access per month or per-scene using our in-house billing software. We’ve been running profitably for the last 21 years making human-friendly porn. **Infrastructure**: All our infra is on AWS. Containerised. ~35 projects, a range of sizes, most strictly separated into Staging and Production environments. **Your colleagues**: We select for passion and devotion to core skills. 28 people, men and women, professionals from all over the world.

Relief periods are scheduled where the Sys Admin is not on-call, on a schedule we all agree to. **How deadlines work**: We don’t do deadlines. We prefer open communication.

Despite the assertion that “data has become the new oil,” the tooling around databases has not meaningfully changed in twenty years. Even with the push for big data and machine learning, a frustrated, growing cadre of data scientists and engineers have to spend too much time setting up and maintaining a basic set up just to use data. bit.io allows users to become immediately productive with data, reducing time from data upload to query to 1 minute. And, our users love it, saying “Your product is amazing”, “really love your product, maybe the best on the market”, and “I am sold on bit.io”. bit.io’s long term vision is to become the place for all the world’s data, private and public, just like github is the place for source code. We’re building a team of passionate dataphiles to make that vision a reality and make data - especially public data - more accessible to everyone. We’ve got a ton of thorny database, infrastructure, UI, and UX problems to solve along the way. Come build it with us. Critical toward achieving bit.io’s vision is a datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies data best practices while remaining flexible when opinionated defaults aren’t enough. You will build bit.io’s datastore. ##As a Software Engineer at bit.io you will: * Work across the stack on all aspects of software engineering for the core product * Collaborate directly with all teammates on a small, productive technology team * Solve petabyte-scale problems in the data space * Design, build, test and deploy a complex data management system * Make broad, impactful technology decisions with responsibility for their outcomes ##We’re looking for someone who has: * Shipped product * Experience and passion in data, data engineering, and data processing * Deep knowledge in data management - parsing, cleaning, querying, extracting, etc. * A strong drive to make software easy-to-use ##The ideal backend engineering candidate will have: * Expertise in Python and SQL * Constructed APIs with technology like REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC * Developed with microservices and container technologies like Docker & Kubernetes * High proficiency in building data processing pipelines, working with structured data, and leveraging common database technologies bit.io is an early-stage, well-funded startup that’s fully remote. We’re outcome-oriented, scientific, curious, respectful, resilient, and inclusive. In addition to competitive salary, equity, bonus, and benefits (including top-tier insurance, generous new-parent leave, and unlimited PTO), we do two unique things: (1) in order to be inclusive and to counter systemic hiring inequities, salary and equity is transparent and not negotiated — every employee with the same role and level is paid exactly the same; and, (2) we have 4-day x 8-hour work weeks (i.e., no Fridays) — we value work-life balance and think you’re just as productive. If you’d like to learn more about what we’re building, how we work, and how your career would develop with us, please reach out to email xa0protected ###Additional Information Links: How Our Early-Stage Startup is Offering Fair Equal and Transpaprent Compensation(https://blog.bit.io/how-our-early-stage-startup-is-offering-fair-equal-and-transparent-compensation-ae582a1ad8e4) We Have A 4-Day Work Week and You Should Too(https://blog.bit.io/we-have-a-four-day-work-week-and-you-should-too-795363c6202a) Be sure to mention the word **ADULATION** when applying to show you read the job post completely.
