Despite the assertion that “data has become the new oil,” the tooling around databases has not meaningfully changed in twenty years. Even with the push for big data and machine learning, a frustrated, growing cadre of data scientists and engineers have to spend too much time setting up and maintaining a basic set up just to use data. bit.io allows users to become immediately productive with data, reducing time from data upload to query to 1 minute. And, our users love it, saying “Your product is amazing”, “really love your product, maybe the best on the market”, and “I am sold on bit.io”.\\nbit.io’s long term vision is to become the place for all the world’s data, private and public, just like github is the place for source code. We’re building a team of passionate dataphiles to make that vision a reality and make data - especially public data - more accessible to everyone. We’ve got a ton of thorny database, infrastructure, UI, and UX problems to solve along the way. Come build it with us.\\nCritical toward achieving bit.io’s vision is a datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies data best practices while remaining flexible when opinionated defaults aren’t enough.

Today, mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow and unstable, and end up costing lenders millions of dollars in other otherwise preventable mistakes every year. LoanCrate solves those problems and more, helping lenders improve the home-buying experience for people all over the country.\\n\\nSince starting in January 2021, our remote team has closed a $4m seed round, grown to 9 people, and launched our first product. And since adopting LoanCrate in June, our customers have used LoanCrate to power ~$7.5b in new home loans. We're on track to achieve strong profitability by mid-2022 after doubling (or more) our team size in the meantime.\\n\\nOur team is a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration, very open communication covering the good & the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly, and ultimately having fun while we take on industry giants. You'll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!\\n\\n## The opportunity\\n\\nOur dreams are big and we have much to build! We're looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year — financial assets worth trillions of dollars).\\n\\nWe are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.\\n\\n## What to expect\\n\\nAs an engineer at LoanCrate, you'll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day! Following that, within your first month, you'll dive into your first mission-critical project, such as...\\n\\n- 🙈 Architecting, building, and launching v2 of our no-code platform that our customers use to digitize their ops workflows and save millions of dollars per year.\\n- 🤝 Integrating with 3rd-party providers of lending services APIs to generate documents/disclosures, produce automated underwriting results, or prevent fraud.\\n- 🏗 Architecting, building, and launching the next generation of our job processing infrastructure on AWS to make LoanCrate's back end more observable and reliable.\\n\\n## Tech stack\\n\\nNearly all of our code is written in TypeScript. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend (running inside Docker), GraphQL/Apollo on both sides, and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, SNS, and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.\\n\\nWe believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and, in turn, our success as a company 😄). Keeping this in mind, we've invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:\\n\\n- ↔️ \xa0**End-to-End Type Safety**\xa0- We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.\\n- 🌎 \xa0**Full-Stack Code Sharing**\xa0- Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client, server, and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.\\n- 🏠 \xa0**Reproducible Infrastructure**\xa0- We’ve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure that's identical to production.\\n- 🧪 \xa0**First Class Testing Utilities**\xa0- We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.\\n\\n## Preferred skills and background\\n\\n(It's okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!) \\n\\n- 🔒 A constant and keen eye for security risks — we store and display some of people's most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!\\n- 🎨 A desire to be product-oriented, from thinking through the product implications of what you're building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.\\n- 🏙️ Ability to develop readable, maintainable, and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).\\n- 👩\u200d🏫👨\u200d🏫 Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.\\n- 🚈 SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and requires minimal toil to maintain.\\n- 🌩️ Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if you're experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!\\n- 🔧 Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.\\n- 🛢️ Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas, as well as figuring out performant ways to store, retrieve, and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields 🙃.\\n \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **PRAISE** when applying to show you read the job post completely. This is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants.

We're looking for someone who understands that security is not gatekeeping but enabling.\\n\\n# What’s a Silverfin?\\nAt Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.\\n\\nThe good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.\\n\\n# What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?\\n\\nWe’re a remote-first engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.\\n\\nWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.\\n\\nBeing remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!\\n\\nWe’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n\\n* Establish Policies and Procedures to help the organization keep up with the pace of application development all the while staying secure and compliant.\\n* Implement initiatives to create security awareness throughout the whole organisation.\\n* Automate core security tasks by embedding security controls early on in the software development lifecycle.\\n* Continuous monitoring and remediation of security defects across the application lifecycle including development and maintenance.\\n* Be the security advisor for product managers, development and system operations.\\n* Help us to set up processes to wade through security questionnaires and certifications. Follow-up on compliance with external auditors, clients, etc. We’re ISO27001 certified and you would play an important role in that going forward.\\n\\n# Requirements\\n\\n* Previous experience with an infosec role\\n* You're able to work independently\\n* You properly document things\\n* Strong organizational, prioritization and communication skills\\n* You’re a team player\\n* Exposure or knowledge of security frameworks like, but not limited to, ISO27001/27005, SOC 2, NIST (800 series, CSF), CIS\\n* You have experience with a couple of the following security technologies: Gauntlt, BDD-Security, Brakeman, ZAP, Burp, Dependency-Check, Error-Prone\\n* Experience with any of the following is a plus: GitLab-CI, Chef, Ruby, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Penetration testing, Incident Response\\n\\n# Our offer\\n* Actual, proper work-life balance\\n* A salary range of €80.000 - €128.000 a year\\n* Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely\\n* Personal growth training and opportunities\\n* Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 35 colleagues in 14 different countries\\n* A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues\\n* A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills\\n* We offer monthly company-wide Wellbeing Days for all employees (10 days off in 2022)\\n \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **INSTRUCTIVE** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.\\n\\nIt has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. \\n\\nWhen you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company. \\n\\nYou will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. \\n\\nOnce you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. \\n\\nYou might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?\\n\\nHere is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):\\n\\n* Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. \\n* Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller. \\n* Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. \\n* Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing\\n* Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. \\n* Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid. \\n* Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing * P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period. \\n* You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. \\n* Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. \\n\\nUltimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. \\n\\n**Love it. What’s the Catch?\xa0**\\n\\nWe love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.\\n\\nA big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.\\n\\nSometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. \\n\\nSometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.\\n\\nA lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.\\n\\nWe focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. \\n\\nWe’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.\\n\\n**What Skills Are Needed?\xa0**\\n\\nWe believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.\\n\\nYou must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. \\n\\nNumbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. \\n\\nYou’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. \\n\\nTechnical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. \\n\\nYou’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.\\n\\n**What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team?\xa0**\\n\\nThe role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. \\n\\nYou will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. \\n\\nThe ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.\\n\\nWe are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our Migration Department in the role of Finance Administrator. Training will commence at the start of January and run approximately 8-12 weeks. \\n\\nWhile the Migration team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (*see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps – the choice is yours. \\n\\nThis is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down. \\n\\nIn order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before. \\n\\nAre you ready to get started?\\nIf this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position.\\n\\n**What’s the Opportunity?\xa0**\\n\\nBecoming a Finance Administrator makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers. \\n\\nYou will represent our brand by working with buyers/sellers and promoting Empire Flipper’s company reputation as a great place to buy/sell a business while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. \\n\\nYour work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least some direct experience or training in an accountancy role.\\n\\nIf you’re a strong numbers person and comfortable with various accountancy practices, we’d like to meet you.\\n\\nOur company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.\\n\\nWe aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. \\n\\nWe are going to rely on your experience to make our earnout process better and smoother for our customers and team. \\n\\nWhen you first start off, you will be training with our Migration Supervisor and other senior migration team members for 8-12 weeks. We typically meet in person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.\\n\\nSpeaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building – we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD). So dust off your passport, and we’ll aim to see you then! \\n\\nFor the first six months, you will be paid $2,700 USD per month during the probation period. After six months, you will be introduced to our compensation plan where you will earn a base pay of $3,000 USD per month plus a performance-based bonus. \\n\\nWithin 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage.
