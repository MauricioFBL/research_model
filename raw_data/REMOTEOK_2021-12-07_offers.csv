They also coach and learn from their colleagues, and constantly better themselves and the people around them. \\nAbout SH:24\\n \\nFirst off, thank you for considering a role with us!\\nSH:24 is a pioneering online sexual and reproductive health service, delivered in partnership with the NHS. We make it easy for people to self-manage their sexual and reproductive health online by providing free STI test kits, contraception & treatment, information and advice - 24 hours a day. Weve won a host of awards and industry recognition for what we do, and were happy to say that our reach and services offered are expanding every day.\\nWe are not-for-profit and passionate about delivering discreet, convenient and clinically safe sexual health services. Our vision is to make it easier and faster for people to access sexual and reproductive health services, no matter where they live; weve been doing it since 2013. Were also proud of our community and the people who work for us; those who have helped us shape a company that puts our users at the heart of everything we do by designing services that are easy to use, easy to access and easy to understand by all that need them.\\nThe Role\\nOur Development Team has recently split into four distinct workstreams to better focus on specific projects and keep context over several months of sustained work. These four streams have responsibilities that span a mix of BAU, Support and tool-improvement, as well as several new projects and the creation of customer-facing sites. We are looking for Senior Full Stack Engineers to help populate these new teams. \\nAt SH:24 we like to keep our stack relatively straight-forward: we build our software primarily in Ruby, most of which is within Ruby on Rails. We have a mixture of full stack Ruby on Rails applications and REST APIs serving React components and in the near future we will look to principally build out our front-end in React. Additionally, all our applications run on AWS, with a deep stack of EC2, EKS, RDS, S3, SQS, Elasticache, all managed using Terraform. Every project is run through CircleCI and we deploy to most of them several times a day.\\nWere big followers of Agile and have daily stand-ups, as well as weekly estimating sessions, refinement sessions, retrospectives, and other Agile ceremonies. We use Clubhouse.io as a kanban/project management tool. We also love pairing and you can expect to work closely with your team either through screen-sharing or, hopefully soon, in person!\\n\\nWhat We Need From You\\n \\n You'll be either an expert in Ruby or an experieneced polyglot with little Ruby experience as well as having a good knowledge of object oriented programming. Youll have extensive experience of working on a delivery team shipping a product to users. \\nYoull have been involved in the front-end side of at least one product, and have a good grasp of what it takes to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a robust and accessible UI for users. Any experience with modern front-end frameworks such as Gatsby or Next.js will be a bonus. \\nYoull also have a good knowledge of databases and how they relate to ORMs. An understanding of SQL and DB performance at scale would be a real advantage. \\nYoull have worked in an environment where developers are exposed to managing cloud infrastructure. You have a working knowledge of AWS and containerisation basics: Virtual servers, networking, Docker and Kubernetes. \\nWell expect you to be able to work on entire features from inception through to delivery. Youll be able to assist in planning and architecture decisions throughout our service and communicate those decisions to other members of the team. \\nWe are big testers here. Wed hope you are too, as well as following good design principles for creating code. You might not know what every letter of SOLID means (although it wouldnt hurt!) but you should be interested to learn and have a good understanding of what it means to create great code. \\nYoull have worked in an Agile environment and be comfortable with its ceremonies and deploying regularly. In time, well need you to join our on-call rota for out of hours support. This is shared amongst all members of the development team and youll be compensated for those times that youre on-call. Finally, and most importantly, you will love to learn, share knowledge and help others. The team at SH:24 is great because we provide the support to each other for everyone to perform well.\\nWhat Youll Get From Us\\nWe are always interested in upskilling our employees, and are flexible in ways to do it: be it courses, books, onsite or remote learning with a colleague - whatever suits the situation best. If there is a particular skill or product you would like to work on and improve, well always try to accommodate you. \\nWere also keen to allow the team to work in the way they want - you can choose the OS of your machine, your chair, standing desk, dual monitors etc. If there is anything you need dont be afraid to ask. \\nAs well as remuneration in the region of £60-85k based on experience, SH:24 provides a number of other benefits, including 25 days of annual holiday (in addition to the days between Christmas and New Year), truly flexible working, excellent pension contributions and life insurance.\\nEquality and Diversity\\n \\nAs an employer, SH:24 is committed to inclusivity.\\nWe want to increase representation of currently under-represented groups to make SH:24 more diverse.\\nBuild an inclusive team, where everyone is able to be themselves at work and feel supported, empowered, valued, respected, fairly treated and able to achieve their full potential.\\nAs an inclusive employer we will not tolerate discrimination.\\n\\nInterview Process\\nThe SH:24 interview process comprises three main sections: \\n1. An interview with a member of the product team or senior management. This is primarily a culture-fit interview but also allows you to get a feel for the company and ask any final questions that may have come up through the process. \\n2. A take-home code test. This is usually completed in Ruby but let us know if you'd like to complete it in another language. As an alternative we're also open to looking at any public code you can send us.\\n3. A pairing interview, consisting of a conversation with two members of the team, along with a pairing exercise relating to the code test submitted. Usually well request an additional feature or suggest a possible refactor for you to try. \\n\\n#Salary and compensation\\n\nNo salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on previous jobs related to Full Stack, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\\n\\n\n$70,000 — $120,000/year\\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more jobs at SH24""]",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK

We also believe that the only way to consistently build those products and experiences is to talk to your customers. Watch what they do. Understand why they do what they do. Figure out why they do things that seem irrational. And once you’ve done that once, do it again. Start having constant conversations. In short, make customers your #1 priority through user research.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nThat’s why we exist. We help teams set up those conversations, allowing them to discover and embrace user insights. We currently do that by making it fast and easy to talk to customers, or potential customers, to help with product, design, or marketing decisions. We work with hundreds of companies every month, including user-centric organizations like Atlassian, Amazon, and Spotify.\\n\\nYou will be reporting to the VP, User Research and the third person on our growing research team. This role will focus on conducting research that helps us make decisions that inform everything from high-level strategy to nitty-gritty usability improvements.

As a member of our research team, this will probably be the most “meta” role of your career, as you’ll be a researcher, doing research about a research tool.

You’ll be expected and trusted to take ownership of your work, and to communicate clearly and transparently with your distributed teammates.\xa0\\n\\nOn a related note, we’re very pro-feedback.

Despite the assertion that “data has become the new oil,” the tooling around databases has not meaningfully changed in twenty years. Even with the push for big data and machine learning, a frustrated, growing cadre of data scientists and engineers have to spend too much time setting up and maintaining a basic set up just to use data. bit.io allows users to become immediately productive with data, reducing time from data upload to query to 1 minute. And, our users love it, saying “Your product is amazing”, “really love your product, maybe the best on the market”, and “I am sold on bit.io”.\\nbit.io’s long term vision is to become the place for all the world’s data, private and public, just like github is the place for source code. We’re building a team of passionate dataphiles to make that vision a reality and make data - especially public data - more accessible to everyone. We’ve got a ton of thorny database, infrastructure, UI, and UX problems to solve along the way. Come build it with us.\\nCritical toward achieving bit.io’s vision is a datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies data best practices while remaining flexible when opinionated defaults aren’t enough. You will build bit.io’s datastore.\\n##As a Software Engineer at bit.io you will:\\n* Work across the stack on all aspects of software engineering for the core product\\n* Collaborate directly with all teammates on a small, productive technology team\\n* Solve petabyte-scale problems in the data space\\n* Design, build, test and deploy a complex data management system\\n* Make broad, impactful technology decisions with responsibility for their outcomes\\n##We’re looking for someone who has:\\n* Shipped product\\n* Experience and passion in data, data engineering, and data processing\\n* Deep knowledge in data management - parsing, cleaning, querying, extracting, etc.\\n* A strong drive to make software easy-to-use\\n##The ideal backend engineering candidate will have:\\n* Expertise in Python and SQL\\n* Constructed APIs with technology like REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC\\n* Developed with microservices and container technologies like Docker & Kubernetes\\n* High proficiency in building data processing pipelines, working with structured data, and leveraging common database technologies\\nbit.io is an early-stage, well-funded startup that’s fully remote. We’re outcome-oriented, scientific, curious, respectful, resilient, and inclusive. In addition to competitive salary, equity, bonus, and benefits (including top-tier insurance, generous new-parent leave, and unlimited PTO), we do two unique things: (1) in order to be inclusive and to counter systemic hiring inequities, salary and equity is transparent and not negotiated — every employee with the same role and level is paid exactly the same; and, (2) we have 4-day x 8-hour work weeks (i.e., no Fridays) — we value work-life balance and think you’re just as productive.

Software Engineer,LoanCrate,💰 $50k - $70k,🌏 Worldwide,2021-11-23T00:00:25+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/106188-remote-software-engineer-loancrate,"[""LoanCrate \n\n\n\nloancrate.com \n\n\nApply now\n\n\n🔎5,139 views\n\n\n✅ 3,249 applied\n(63%)\n\n\n\nLoanCrate is hiring a Remote Software Engineer \n## What is LoanCrate?\\n\\nWe started LoanCrate to make home-buying simpler and less expensive for lenders and borrowers (us!). Today, mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow and unstable, and end up costing lenders millions of dollars in other otherwise preventable mistakes every year. LoanCrate solves those problems and more, helping lenders improve the home-buying experience for people all over the country.\\n\\nSince starting in January 2021, our remote team has closed a $4m seed round, grown to 9 people, and launched our first product. And since adopting LoanCrate in June, our customers have used LoanCrate to power ~$7.5b in new home loans. We're on track to achieve strong profitability by mid-2022 after doubling (or more) our team size in the meantime.\\n\\nOur team is a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration, very open communication covering the good & the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly, and ultimately having fun while we take on industry giants. You'll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!\\n\\n## The opportunity\\n\\nOur dreams are big and we have much to build! We're looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year — financial assets worth trillions of dollars).\\n\\nWe are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.\\n\\n## What to expect\\n\\nAs an engineer at LoanCrate, you'll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day! Following that, within your first month, you'll dive into your first mission-critical project, such as...\\n\\n- 🙈 Architecting, building, and launching v2 of our no-code platform that our customers use to digitize their ops workflows and save millions of dollars per year.\\n- 🤝 Integrating with 3rd-party providers of lending services APIs to generate documents/disclosures, produce automated underwriting results, or prevent fraud.\\n- 🏗 Architecting, building, and launching the next generation of our job processing infrastructure on AWS to make LoanCrate's back end more observable and reliable.\\n\\n## Tech stack\\n\\nNearly all of our code is written in TypeScript. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend (running inside Docker), GraphQL/Apollo on both sides, and Postgres as our database. We use AWS (ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, SNS, and more) and manage all of our infrastructure with Terraform.\\n\\nWe believe that high engineering velocity drives high product velocity (and, in turn, our success as a company 😄). Keeping this in mind, we've invested heavily in creating a great developer experience that enables engineers to ship fast. Some highlights of our stack:\\n\\n- ↔️ \xa0**End-to-End Type Safety**\xa0- We generate TypeScript types from our Postgres and GraphQL schemas so that when we change our database schema we see type errors in any incompatible frontend React components.\\n- 🌎 \xa0**Full-Stack Code Sharing**\xa0- Our build tooling supports seamless sharing of TypeScript files between the client, server, and other packages in our mono-repo so that we never have to define functions or configuration values twice.\\n- 🏠 \xa0**Reproducible Infrastructure**\xa0- We’ve used Terraform to manage 100% of our infrastructure since day 1 and have configured our CI pipeline to automatically deploy temporary staging environments for every pull request. We use these per-PR environments to get feedback from teammates and test any infrastructure changes using infrastructure that's identical to production.\\n- 🧪 \xa0**First Class Testing Utilities**\xa0- We have a comprehensive library of utilities that mock production-like data and feed automated end-to-end, integration, and performance tests. Our wide-ranging test suite allows us to move fast while maintaining nearly perfect uptime.\\n\\n## Preferred skills and background\\n\\n(It's okay not to have all of these things - these are just some skills we are excited about!) \\n\\n- 🔒 A constant and keen eye for security risks — we store and display some of people's most sensitive personal data and need to keep it safe!\\n- 🎨 A desire to be product-oriented, from thinking through the product implications of what you're building to contributing your unique ideas of how to improve the product.\\n- 🏙️ Ability to develop readable, maintainable, and effective software architecture patterns that support use of our product by various enterprise customers (each with thousands of employees and their own methods for running their companies).\\n- 👩\u200d🏫👨\u200d🏫 Excitement to mentor less senior engineers in both hard and soft skills.\\n- 🚈 SRE-oriented mindset for developing infrastructure that's reliable, observable, and requires minimal toil to maintain.\\n- 🌩️ Experience scaling high-throughput distributed systems in the cloud. Bonus points if you're experienced with infrastructure-as-code solutions like Terraform or CloudFormation!\\n- 🔧 Ability to develop full-stack web app features from design through deployment.\\n- 🛢️ Experience designing and scaling complex relational DB schemas, as well as figuring out performant ways to store, retrieve, and update such data. Home loans have thousands of data fields 🙃.\\n \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **PRAISE** when applying to show you read the job post completely. This is a beta feature to avoid spam applicants. Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this and see they're human.\\n\\n \\n\\n#Salary and compensation\\n\n$120,000 — $300,000/year\\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more jobs at LoanCrate\n\n\nVisit LoanCrate's website""]",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK
