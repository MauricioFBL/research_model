This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth---and there is no sign of it slowing down.\\n\\nWe truly believe in the power of inbound marketing and have had outstanding success with it over the years. With a double-sided marketplace and lengthy sales cycle, there are an abundance of opportunities to market to our audience depending on where they are in their journey.\\n\\n**What\'s the Position Like?**\\n\\nAs the Demand Generation Specialist at Empire Flippers, you\'ll be a vital part of our marketing team. You\'ll work closely with other team members to plan, coordinate, execute, and evaluate your demand gen strategies.\\n\\nHere are some typical responsibilities for this position:\\n\\n- Create and manage content that attracts qualified audiences such as eBooks, reports, webinars, and infographics\\n- Create lead magnet funnels from scratch --- landing page, thank you page, delivery, follow-up, etc.\\n- Use HubSpot to track lead nurturing performance through email campaigns, content marketing, paid media and social media channels to identify opportunities for new campaigns or strategies\\n- Maintain audience segmentation to ensure prospects, leads, and customers are receiving valuable content relevant to them\\n- Meet KPI goals for lifecycle stages (subscriber, lead, MQL, etc.), calls scheduled, content downloads, marketplace interactions, and form submissions\\n\\n**What Skills Do I Need?**\\n\\n**You need to have immaculate attention to detail.**\xa0Since our marketing campaigns reach hundreds of thousands of people, one slight mistake can easily hurt conversions. We are looking for a detail-oriented individual that also knows which aspects of a project to be most careful with.\\n\\n**A can-do attitude.**\xa0You understand resilience and being able to power through obstacles that come your way. You\'re open to collaboration to get things done and you try to bring your best to everything you do.\\n\\n**Be a good communicator.**\xa0Good communication will be an essential part of this role. Not only will you need it to coordinate with other team members, but your work may be the first thing a prospect sees, so we are after someone that can deliver on messaging on voice.\\n\\n**A self-starter.**\xa0We need to see some evidence that you\'re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you\'ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won\'t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day-to-day basis, so you\'ll be working in almost full autonomy. We\'ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. In a nutshell: you must be highly motivated, goal-driven, and coachable.\\n\\n**Affinity for writing and design.**\xa0While we welcome collaboration with other content creators on the team, this role will require you to create some content on your own. Experience with writing, graphic design, and web design will be extremely valuable to us.\\n\\n**Required Skills**\\n\\n- Intermediate to advanced HubSpot Marketing Hub knowledge with focus on email, workflows, design tools, and contact management\\n- Intermediate to advanced marketing funnel knowledge\\n- Basic to intermediate graphic design knowledge, preferably with Illustrator, Photoshop, or InDesign\\n- Basic to intermediate web design knowledge, mainly HTML and CSS\\n- Basic to intermediate SEO knowledge\xa0\\n- Basic to intermediate CRO knowledge\\n- Copywriting experience\\n\\n**Preferred Skills**\\n\\nOther software knowledge that isn\'t required, but we find valuable:\\n\\n- Monday.com productivity tool\\n- HubSpot Sales Hub\\n- Google Analytics\\n- Google Data Studio\\n- Ahrefs\\n\\n**What\'s the Lifestyle Like?**\\n\\nOur company culture is built on the idea of travel, remote work, and living life on your terms.\\n\\nWe\'re not looking to put you in a cubicle and waste your time in traffic. You\'ll be working hard, playing hard, and learning all about our company and what we stand for during this time.\\n\\nApart from meeting us in person every now and then, you\'re free to work and live anywhere you\'d like and join the new class of digital nomads -- we\'re homeless but have a passport, credit card, and a laptop.\\n\\nYou\'ll become friends with people who will be able to give you massive insights into how digital businesses work, how they scale, and, of course, how to invest in them or sell them.\\n\\n**Love It. What\'s the Catch?**\\n\\nThis isn\'t a gap year experience. This is not a temporary contract.\\n\\nIf you\'re applying just because you want something to fund your travels before you start seeking out a ""serious"" job, then you probably shouldn\'t apply.\\n\\nWe\'re looking for career-minded people who share our vision and see where we\'re going. We want you to be part of that vision and help us get there over the long haul.\\n\\nAnd while we play hard and sometimes really do work next to the pool all day, we work even harder. Sometimes you will be putting in a 10-12 hour day as business demands arise. You\'ll be working weird hours to match other team members time zones, and you\'ll sometimes have to face some critical feedback.\\n\\nYou will be expected to perform to our expectations and really help us grow our business to the next level. We\'re counting on you.\\n\\nIf you can see yourself growing into a profitable and meaningful career with us and love what we do, we want you to be part of our team.\\n\\n**Details to Keep in Mind**\\n\\nWhile the\xa0 Demand Generation Specialist role will in large part be built from scratch, this position itself is not an entry level role. You will earn $2,000/month base rate plus immediately join our lucrative bonus sharing plan. Should company performance hit 100% of on-target earnings, this role has a very good opportunity to earn $65,000 in the first year.\\n\\nWe\'re going to start you off slow. You\'ll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position. Over time, your skills will grow and you\'ll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We aren\'t going to throw you to the wolves --- you\'ll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can.\\n\\nOur Director of Marketing and Marketing Ops Supervisor will be reviewing every application. If we think you\'re a good fit, we will reach out to you to do a video call interview. After the first interviews are done, our final candidates will be brought back for a final second interview before we make our decision.\\n\\n***US resident requirements: If you are in the US, we will accept candidates residing in Texas, Florida, or Colorado, as we are registered for payroll in these states. Otherwise, US candidates should plan to live abroad or have plans to relocate to Texas, Florida, or Colorado.**\\n\\n**We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us.

Whether it's a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours.\\n\\nWe're looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You'll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who's already done it successfully.\\n\\nYou'll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You'll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you.\\n\\nThe industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale.\\n\\nThis is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard.\\n\\nReady to get started?\\n\\nIf this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position!\\n\\n**So What is a Content Marketing Specialist?**\\n\\nA Content Specialist is a marketing professional who works on many different marketing channels for EF Capital. The high level responsibilities are to spread the word about this exciting new investment platform, maintain an online presence in relevant communities, and support the team by increasing conversions.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for writing content in the form of blog posts, email blasts to investors and operators, developing sales marketing collateral for our webpage, and reviewing other online investment platforms to ensure we are staying competitive.\\n\\nYou will also be responsible for writing and publishing our quarterly investment reports as well as acquisition updates for our investors.\\n\\nThis includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love the challenge of writing across many different mediums.\\n\\nIf you're selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it's a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Content Marketing Specialist.\\n\\n**What's Our Story?**\\n\\nEF Capital is the latest division of Empire Flippers that enables investors to own fractional pieces of high-growth internet businesses. This is done by providing a marketplace to match up passive investors and experienced online business operators to purchase and run profitable online businesses.\\n\\nEmpire Flippers was started back in 2011 as a place to buy small advertising sites. The company was started by two founders working from home and now has more than 85 people working all around the world, successfully selling more than $360,000,000 in online businesses.\\n\\nThe goal remains simple -- connect the sellers of high quality businesses with entrepreneurial buyers.\\n\\nThe problem EF Capital solves is that buying an online business requires a particular skill-set -- one that many investors, high net-worth individuals, and investment funds just don't have. This skill-set issue is a limiting factor that, once solved, could open the floodgates in taking this asset class mainstream.\\n\\nEmpire Flippers has already established incredible market demand. The company has more than $5.5 billion in verified liquidity from potential investors with more being added every month.\\n\\nEF Capital is in a unique position to pair investable capital with our established network of accomplished and experienced entrepreneurs and portfolio managers.\\n\\nIn our first year we successfully completed 2 Rounds of EFC funding $13M+. Our Round 1 operators are growing their businesses and our Round 2 operators are in the process of deploying capital. We're now ready to expand the program so that we can start operating at even greater scale.\\n\\nThat's where you come in!\\n\\n**What's the Opportunity?**\\n\\nBecoming a Content Specialist will put you in a critical role at EF Capital.\\n\\nYou'll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way.\\n\\nWhile we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it's not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector.\\n\\nYou won't be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won't be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You'll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity.\\n\\nYour work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You'll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you.\\n\\nYou'll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands.\\n\\nDo you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry?\\n\\nIf we're a good fit for each other, that's exactly what you'll get with this position.\\n\\n**What's This Content Specialist Position Like?**\\n\\nWhile you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we're not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we're completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics.\\n\\nYou'll find much of the same at EF Capital.\\n\\nWhen you first come on board as a Content Marketing Specialist, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to the intricacies of business acquisitions. You will learn about what each department in the company does and who to work with to accomplish your projects.\\n\\nOnce you have the basics down, you will start working with our team, contractors, and customers directly. This is not a sales role but you will spend a significant amount of time collaborating with others and must be very comfortable jumping on calls and collaborating with other team members when needed. You will wear many different hats and will need to prioritize projects based on urgency and importance.\\n\\nYou might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you're up and going?\\n\\nWhile you will work on many different things and each day could look different to the next, here is an example of potential tasks:\\n\\n- Writing sales and marketing collateral for our website (landing page, FAQ, and investment deal pages)\\n- Developing email blasts that drive traffic to our sales team\xa0\\n- Being an active poster in various investing and online business communities\\n- Writing blog posts with content that captures the tone of our mission and brings new investors into the fold\\n- Providing quarterly updates on each investment deal to investors throughout the life of each investment\\n- Figuring out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators\\n\\n**What Skills Are Needed?**\\n\\nWe believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.\\n\\nHowever, that doesn't mean we aren't looking for a certain kind of skill-set.\\n\\nYou must have an affinity for writing. You either have a portfolio of published work or are actively learning about how to be a better writer. Maybe you're passionate about writing and creating content and you naturally gravitate towards anything related to that sphere. You'll be writing a lot in this role so being able to show an interest and foundation in writing is essential.\\n\\nExperience writing in the finance and investment space is a big plus. You need to be able to create content that will resonate with investors. Having the ability to understand complex financial concepts and write about them clearly and succinctly is essential for this role. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don't have that experience, don't let it stop you from applying.\\n\\nYou need to be a team player. You'll be working closely with multiple teams and contractors. You need to be good at communicating your thoughts and getting buy-in from colleagues. Having a deadline focus and being able to knock down barriers to getting stuff done is essential to thriving on our team.\\n\\nYou're excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.\\n\\n**What's the Lifestyle Like?**\\n\\nOur company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits!\\n\\nWe aren't going to chain you to a cubicle. You'll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won't be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators.\\n\\nWe typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions,\xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won't be a hiring requirement.\\n\\nOur company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas!\\n\\nFor the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance and experience. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay.\\n\\n**Love It. What's the Catch?**\\n\\nWe love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations.

Whether it\'s a beach in Bali, the side-streets of Tokyo, or a villa in Mexico -- the choice is yours.\\n\\nWe\'re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters, excited about building a new division of an established, exciting internet company. You\'ll help build this new venture from the ground up, but with the guidance and expertise of a management team who\'s already done it successfully.\\n\\nYou\'ll be plugging into a network of business professionals who invest, buy, and run successful, profitable internet companies. You\'ll be working with other driven professionals and mentored by a management team that truly wants to bring the best out in you.\\n\\nThe industry is going through a period of explosive growth and our company is on the bleeding edge of investing in online businesses. This new asset class has been exploding in recent years and we need your help to scale.\\n\\nThis is the position we wished we had when we were starting out! A remote position in a kick-ass remote company that works and plays hard.\\n\\nReady to get started?\\n\\nIf this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position!\\n\\n**So What is an Investment Advisor?**\\n\\nAn Investment Advisor is a sales professional who works directly with portfolio managers (operators) and investors on the EF Capital platform.\\n\\nYou will be responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with online entrepreneurs who want to operate portfolios for EF Capital.\\n\\nYou will also be responsible for working with existing and new investors who wish to passively invest in online businesses.\\n\\nThis includes explaining EF Capital terms, processes, and the benefits of working with us. The person in this role must love talking with people.\\n\\nIf you\'re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it\'s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Investment Advisor.\\n\\n**What\'s the Opportunity?**\\n\\nBecoming an Investment Advisor will put you in a critical role at EF Capital.\\n\\nYou\'ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment. The work will be challenging and you may find yourself wearing several different hats along the way.\\n\\nWhile we have the support and backing of a larger established company and brand, it\'s not wrong to say this will compare closely to a rapidly growing startup in the financial services sector.\\n\\nYou won\'t be another cog in the wheel of some larger corporation. You won\'t be employee #30492 looking to skate by and hope that your peers or supervisor can cover for you. You\'ll be an absolutely critical player in a company with big expectations and opportunity.\\n\\nYour work ethic and skill-set will have a direct impact on our growth. You\'ll gain access to our Rolodex, receive direct training, mentorship and support, and gain valuable insights into the online business space that no course could ever teach you.\\n\\nYou\'ll be working right away with savvy investors, successful entrepreneurs running dozens or hundreds of sites, and portfolio owners and management teams running global product brands.\\n\\nDo you want a seat at the table? A real shot to be a leader and have a voice in a fast-growing industry?\\n\\nIf we\'re a good fit for each other, that\'s exactly what you\'ll get with this position.\\n\\n**What\'s This Investment Advisor Position Like?**\\n\\nWhile you can expect to work hard and wear many different hats, we\'re not terribly corporate. Empire Flippers has been an INC 5000 company for a number of years, but we\'re completely bootstrapped, have no board to answer to, and are focused on results, not politics.\\n\\nYou\'ll find much of the same at EF Capital.\\n\\nWhen you first come on board as an Investment Advisor, you will start learning more about our industry before jumping into the job. First you will learn about the different types of online businesses available for sale on Empire Flippers. Then you will learn about EF Capital. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how investments are structured down to intricacies of business acquisitions.\\n\\nOnce you have the basics down, you will use the phone, chat systems, and email to communicate with our customers and will have access to our backend support systems through HubSpot, Zendesk, and our custom software platform.\\n\\nYou might be wondering, though ... what will your daily work routine really look like once you\'re up and going?\\n\\nHere is a list of daily tasks we\'ll expect from you (not exhaustive and subject to change):\\n\\n- Take calls with potential operators and answering their questions on how we structure investment deals and how they can participate\\n- Call potential investors who have expressed interest in investing and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel\\n- Return emails to potential operators or investors who are looking at using our platform, but still have questions about our process\\n- Work closely with our team to improve marketing based on your conversations with investors and operators\xa0\\n- Figure out ways to improve our existing process to make it a better experience for both investors and operators\\n\\n**What Skills Are Needed?**\\n\\nWe believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.\\n\\nHowever, that doesn\'t mean we aren\'t looking for a certain kind of skill-set.\\n\\nWhile no previous work experience is needed, experience in sales is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don\'t have that experience, don\'t let it stop you from applying.\\n\\nYou must love talking with people. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn\'t know you and see how they are doing. This isn\'t cold-calling, everyone you call will have expressed some interest in working with EF Capital and have given out their phone number, so they will be familiar with the company. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with.\\n\\nYou can spot risks and opportunities. Every day, you will speak with investors and entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot genuine risks and opportunities with online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story behind each potential investment opportunity. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in.\\n\\nWe take a consultative approach with customers. We\'re not trying to fit square pegs into round holes. We truly believe that the best sales experience includes transparency -- which sometimes means letting the customer know why they shouldn\'t do the deal. Having that confidence will allow you to be that much more effective and persuasive when the right customer is looking at the right deal.\\n\\nAlong those lines, we respect our audience\'s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards.\\n\\nYou\'re a problem solver. Investing in these businesses can be a very important decision and a very intimate experience for entrepreneurs and operators on the other side of the deal. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved for all parties in the deal.\\n\\nYou\'re excited about expanding the EF Capital brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.\\n\\n**What\'s the Lifestyle Like?**\\n\\nOur company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits!\\n\\nWe aren\'t going to chain you to a cubicle. You\'ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves you best. The choice is yours. You won\'t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our investors and operators.\\n\\nWe typically require all new hires to work in-person with their manager for the first 3-6 months to get up to speed quickly and create a close knit group. After that, employees are free to live anywhere in the world. Due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions,\xa0**we are not making this a requirement**. We will offer an optional 2-month in-person training in either Medellin, Colombia or Phuket, Thailand with the EF Capital Team. Again, attending this in-person training is optional and won\'t be a hiring requirement.\\n\\nOur company holds biannual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. Our meetups were on hold for 2020, but in 2021 we were able to gather together again as a team for a fun filled week in Las Vegas!\\n\\nFor the first 6 months, you will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. After 6 months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan and will have paid, international healthcare coverage. Within 12 months, you can expect to be earning $60,000 -- $80,000 USD per year depending on performance. With this being a new venture, there is a lot of opportunity to move into management roles with significantly higher pay.\\n\\n**Love It. What\'s the Catch?**\\n\\nWe love our team and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.\\n\\nWe love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work awfully hard.\\n\\nSometimes we have to work weird hours.

You will also work with outside contracts such as our fund administrator, legal, and accounting.\\n\\nAlso you will be responsible for working with our customer service team and resolving complex issues escalated to you and improving the customer experience.\\n\\nIf you\'re selected, and after a six month probationary period -- assuming it\'s a good fit for everyone -- you will be invited to join our team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Project Manager.\\n\\n**What\'s Our Story?**\\n\\nEF Capital is the latest division of Empire Flippers that enables investors to own fractional pieces of high-growth internet businesses. This is done by providing a marketplace to match up passive investors and experienced online business operators to purchase and run profitable online businesses.\\n\\nEmpire Flippers was started back in 2011 as a place to buy small advertising sites. The company was started by two founders working from home and now has more than 85 people working all around the world, successfully selling more than $360,000,000 in online businesses.\\n\\nThe goal remains simple -- connect the sellers of high quality businesses with entrepreneurial buyers.\\n\\nThe problem EF Capital solves is that buying an online business requires a particular skill-set -- one that many investors, high net-worth individuals, and investment funds just don\'t have. This skill-set issue is a limiting factor that, once solved, could open the floodgates in taking this asset class mainstream.\\n\\nEmpire Flippers has already established incredible market demand. The company has more than $5.5 billion in verified liquidity from potential investors with more being added every month.\\n\\nEF Capital is in a unique position to pair investable capital with our established network of accomplished and experienced entrepreneurs and portfolio managers.\\n\\nIn our first year we successfully completed 2 Rounds of EFC funding $13M+. Our Round 1 operators are growing their businesses and our Round 2 operators are in the process of deploying capital. We\'re now ready to expand the program so that we can start operating at even greater scale.\\n\\nThat\'s where you come in!\\n\\n**What\'s the Opportunity?**\\n\\nBecoming a Project Manager will put you in a critical role at EF Capital.\\n\\nYou\'ll be joining a very fast-paced team in a high-growth environment.

Becoming a Content Specialist makes you a critical part of Empire Flippers. You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and work to coordinate, produce, and edit content for Empire Flippers. Your goal is to increase lead nurturing at every single level of the marketing funnel using content.\\n\\nThis is a full-time position and great for those who are curious and love to expand their knowledge. The online business industry is vast. You\'ll cover everything from eCommerce, SaaS, private equity, affiliate marketing, SEO, to entrepreneurship, just to name a few. In this role, you\'ll become a powerhouse creator who can deliver content on just about every topic in online business.\\n\\n**What\'s the Position Like?**\\n\\nThe Content Specialist position is vital to the success of our company.\\n\\nTo excel in this role you should be a strong communicator, writer, and storyteller. You have a sense of what is most compelling to an audience and understand what they might need to hear/read to walk away feeling like they got value from a piece of content. You should be able to deliver on the voice and quality standards of Empire Flippers content alone and in collaboration with our marketing team.\\n\\nSpeaking of collaboration -- you should feel excited about really nesting into our marketing team. We work closely together to meet our quarterly and yearly goals and you\'ll regularly meet with the team to make sure you\'re on track. But outside of a few regular meetings, for the most part, you\'re independent and working on your own time to craft great content. The ability to be self-sufficient and thrive in an independent environment will be important.\\n\\nHere\'s a look at some of the tasks and processes you\'ll be responsible for:\\n\\n**Routine Job Duties**\\n\\n- Writing listing descriptions for new businesses going live on our marketplace\\n- Outreach to off-site publications and websites with a goal of creating 1 in-depth industry-related blog post per month.\\n- Optimize content with best SEO industry practices.\\n- Publishing story and data-driven blog content twice a month.\\n- Monitor mentions and backlinks across the web for potential content opportunities.\\n- Manage and improve the ongoing editorial calendar.\\n- Interviewing sellers for the RMRB podcast\\n\\n**Big projects content specialists could collaborate on:**\\n\\n- Content repurposing\\n- Creating graphics for content\\n- Data-driven content\\n- Customized email marketing campaigns\\n- Collaboration on large marketing campaigns i.e Season of the Seller\\n- Launching new podcasts and YouTube shows\\n\\n**What Skills Do I Need?**\\n\\nWe train you for every facet of the job and believe cultural fit is most important when we are hiring. So you\'ll learn everything on the job but you should come to the table with these qualities and skills.\\n\\n**Affinity for writing**. You either have a portfolio of published work or are actively learning about how to be a better writer. Maybe you\'re passionate about writing and creating content and you naturally gravitate towards anything related to that sphere. You\'ll be writing a lot in this role so being able to show an interest or foundation in writing will be helpful.\\n\\n**A can-do attitude**. You understand resilience and being able to power through obstacles that come your way. You\'re open to collaboration to get things done and you try to bring your best to everything you do.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you\'ll be brainstorming with team members in other departments, developing and collaborating on overall content strategy for both short-term and long-term goals, and creating new content ideas.\\n\\n**A self-starter**. We need to see some evidence that you\'re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you\'ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won\'t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day-to-day basis, you\'ll be working in almost full autonomy, we\'ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. In a nutshell: you must be highly motivated, goal-driven, and coachable.\\n\\n**You need to have immaculate attention to detail**. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if a word or grammatical structure doesn\'t quite look or feel right, as you\'ll be creating two pieces of in-depth written content per month to be published on the blog. Writing, editing, and proofreading are a large part of this role for all content being produced.\\n\\n**Preferred Skills**\\n\\n- A deep understanding of crafting written, story-driven content marketing pieces\\n- Strong emphasis on editing skills across various writing styles to ensure overall brand messaging remains top of mind\\n- Basic to intermediate social media knowledge\\n- Basic to intermediate SEO knowledge\\n- Basic to intermediate email marketing automation knowledge\\n- Basic to intermediate graphic design skills\\n- Podcast and video production knowledge\\n- Journalism background\\n\\n- Especially in Amazon FBA, DTC e-commerce or SaaS related\\n\\n**What\'s the Lifestyle Like?**\\n\\n[](https://empireflippers.com/)\\n\\n[**Empire Flippers**](https://empireflippers.com/) has grown tremendously in the past few years and we are now a team of 80 people dispersed across the entire globe.\\n\\nOur company culture is built on the idea of travel, remote work, and living life on your terms.\\n\\nWe\'re not looking to put you in a cubicle and waste your time in traffic. You\'ll be working hard, playing hard, and learning all about our company and what we stand for during this time.\\n\\nApart from meeting us in person every now and then, you\'re free to work and live anywhere you\'d like and join the new class of digital nomads -- we\'re homeless but have a passport, credit card, and a laptop.\\n\\nThe marketing team is where you\'ll call home. We are a close-knit team of eight currently and are expanding to a team of 10-14 very soon. Currently, we\'re located in Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, The Philippines, United Kingdom, Croatia, and Mexico. Though that location often changes, thanks to all that remote work freedom.\\n\\nWe work hard together, support each other, and have a good sense of humor. We want to see each other win because we know that creates a winning scenario for our customers and Empire Flippers as a whole. Our new hires will be an important part of our team and will be working closely with the entirety of our marketing team and will regularly connect with Empire Flippers\' other departments.\\n\\n**Love It. What\'s the Catch?**\\n\\nThis isn\'t a gap year experience. This is not a temporary contract.\\n\\nIf you\'re applying just because you want something to fund your travels before you start seeking out a ""serious"" job, then you probably shouldn\'t apply.\\n\\nWe\'re looking for career-minded people who share our vision and see where we\'re going. We want you to be part of that vision and help us get there over the long haul.\\n\\nAnd while we play hard and sometimes really do work next to the pool all day, we work even harder. Sometimes you will be putting in a 10-12 hour day as business demands arise. You\'ll be working weird hours to match other team members time zones, and you\'ll sometimes have to face some critical feedback.\\n\\nYou will be expected to perform to our expectations and really help us grow our business to the next level. We\'re counting on you.\\n\\nIf you can see yourself growing into a profitable and meaningful career with us and love what we do, we want you to be part of our team.\\n\\n**Details to Keep in Mind**\\n\\nThis position is a fully remote role. During the first six month period, your role will be probationary and your training and performance will be evaluated. You can expect to be earning $2,000/month base rate. Following probation, you will join our lucrative bonus sharing plan. Should company performance hit 100% of on target earnings, this role has a very good opportunity to earn between $50,000-$60,000 annually.\\n\\nWe also offer international healthcare coverage that you will receive once you\'re out of the probationary period. We offer a stellar unlimited PTO (paid time off)\xa0 policy as well.\\n\\nWe\'re going to start you off slow. You\'ll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position. Over time, your skills will grow and you\'ll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We aren\'t going to throw you to the wolves --- you\'ll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can.\\n\\n***US resident requirements: If you\'re in the US, we will accept candidates residing in Texas, Florida, or Colorado, as we are registered for payroll in these states. Otherwise, US candidates should plan to live abroad or have plans to relocate to Texas, Florida, or Colorado.**\\n\\n**We have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.**\\n\\n**A background check is required.\xa0**\\n\\nHere is the sequence of events we use when hiring our Content Specialist:\\n\\n- You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you\'re a good fit for the position.\\n- The deadline is February 11, 2022.\\n- We review submissions and schedule interviews in mid February.\\n- The chosen candidate will begin March 16, 2022.\\n\\n***YouTube Video Requirements:**\\n\\nWe will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video ""unlisted"" in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn\'t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We just want (up to) three minutes of you explaining (based on your previous experience) why this position is an excellent fit for you and us.\\n\\nIf you\'re thinking about applying but are worried you might not have enough (insert excuse here) --- don\'t worry.

We’re in the business of giving our customers energy. When we stay focused on that need, customers are happy.\\n\\n\\nIt turns out that the biggest determinant of your energy levels is your sleep. However, the tools available today are focused on speciality niches. Some are trying to help you fall asleep (like Calm) and others measure every physiological asepct your sleep (like Fitbit, Whoop, & Oura). While those businesses have executed very well they’re relevant for maybe ~15% of the population.\\n\\nWe’ve always believed there’s a significantly larger opportunity for impact by focusing on what the vast majority of us want: more energy. We all want more energy. Just last year, consumers spent a trillion dollars on caffeine alone. A trillion dollars on a drug that gives us a short-high. We believe people want real energy. We believe that people are changing how they view their health and turning to much healthier, scientifically sound solutions.\\n\\nWhen you’re squarely focused on the need for more energy you design a much different solution than what exists. Rather than helping you fall asleep or track your sleep with hardware, our app uses behavioral data from phone to analyze how much sleep debt you have and your circadian rhythm so you can forecast exactly how much energy you’ll have during the day and manage your energy.\\n\\nIt allows for some powerful use-cases:\xa0**\\n\\n* when your morning grogginess will end\\n* when to stop drinking caffeine\\n* when to exercise\\n* when you’ll be most productive\\n* when to eat lunch\\n* when to stop work and start watching Netflix\\n* and the best time to be sleeping\\n\\nIt’s taken a decade of rigorous work and research to get here. We’ve invested millions of dollars (from the investors behind Peloton, Fitbit, Spotify, Facebook, and Twitter) and have millions of nights of data from 1m+ users - from high schoolers to pro athletes, working parents to retirees - to design and build scientifically robust algorithms to help people live the best lives possible.\\n\\nIf you want to see it for yourself, start a free trial.\\n\\nYour challenge is helping more people have confidence to give Rise a try.\\nIn 2021 we had 1 million people install RISE. 200k started a trial. Your job is to ultimately increase the percent of folks who install that start a trial with us. To do that, you’ll need to help our new installers to feel incredibly confident RISE will help them take control of their sleep and energy.\\n\\nDoing this well won’t be one of those jobs you can coast and get by. You’ll need to be ready to build. But if you put 8 hours a day of solid work, and you’re the right fit, you’ll directly improve the lives of millions of people in 2022.\\n\\nHere’s why you might not be a fit:\\n\\nWe’ve learned our day to day environment is unique. If you feel super confident about these three areas, we should talk. If not, you won’t find success in the role:\\n\\n* Customer problems start out fuzzy. About ~50% of the time there aren’t clear patterns in similar products. If you’re not an expert in collaborating with engineers and PMs to go from fuzzy to clear testable solution you’ll spin your wheels and will feel unproductive.\\n\\n* You’ll need to design polished consumer experiences quickly, without a well established, robust design system. If you’re more comfortable moving fast when working from a well established, robust design system you’re going to struggle in this role. If you can’t expertly and quickly build your own sensible patterns and components for native mobile, you’ll feel behind. The impact to the business is that visual and interaction issues will show up clearly in the quant data which slows down progress.\\n\\n* The area of sleep and human energy is complex. If you aren’t naturally relentless in teaching yourself, going deep on problems, digging into peer-reviewed research and books, you’ll struggle to develop useful and novel solutions. We expect our product teams to become the subject matter experts. We don’t lean on a board of advisors or internal sleep scientists to make day to day product decisions.\\n\\nCompany culture and stage\\n\\n* Mediocre performance results in generous severance. At our size, we can only afford to keep our highly effective people. The upside of this is that you’re working with others who are performing at a really high level.\\n\\n* We encourage the people making, to make the decisions. Our core philosophy is that we value great people over process and we trust you to make informed decisions.\\n\\n* Progress and growth every day matters. If you struggle to unblock yourself quickly when you’re stuck, ask for help, receive constructive feedback, or aren’t extraordinarily candid, you should consider another company.\\n\\n* We are building a product together. Product, design, engineering all sit at the same table, and we are all listening to the user. If you don’t find yourself inspired by non-designers or it’s difficult for you to let go of your idea, you’re not going to be happy here.\\n* We don’t have all the answers. If you don’t enjoy being in the uncomfortable space of not knowing and figuring out how to learn the answer, this isn’t for you.\\n\\n* We avoid rules and believe in people over process. If you do your best work in a process-driven, rules-based environment and get uncomfortable that we rely on good judgement, you won’t be happy at Rise.\\n\\nYou’ll have every resource you need to do your best work.\\n\\nYou’ll be part of a dedicated empowered team thats focused on the same problem you are. That means you can maximize your time focusing on discovering the right problems to solve. And then solve it well. No other fluff. You and Kellie own the strategy and have the engineering resources to build and learn quickly. Here’s a quick run-down of who you’re working with:\\n\\n1. Kellie runs product management. She’ll be your partner on end-to-end shipping: strategy, customer discovery, solutions & analytics. Before Rise, Kellie was a psychology researcher in stress and emotions and led mobile app growth at Wayfair.\\n\\n2. Greg leads backend and decided to end his PhD in cell biology to write software. Working at a science-based company is his dream job.\\n\\n3. Graham leads front-end. Before falling in love with front-end, he produced gangster rap beats.\\n\\nYou’ll have data to learn incredibly quickly. We’ve instrumented our whole product for doing high quality research. Need 5 people that installed but didn’t start a trial to test a prototype? We can get them on zoom in 24 hours. You’ll also know how your solutions impacted customer behavior. We ship every new feature as a randomized controlled trial. This means you can see how your solution is working leading to much better and faster iterations. Lastly, you’re not starting from scratch. We know quite a bit about who these customers are and why they’re not starting trials.\\n\\nDesign works well at Rise. Jason, who heads our design function, has been designing interfaces professionally since 1998. He was at Rise in 2018 when it was bunch of ideas cobbled together and his work has enabled us to go from 0 to 1m+ installs last year. He’s an expert. A rare breed that has done it all. Leading big teams, being the principal designer, deep in product, deep in marketing. You get the idea. You’ll get to learn directly with him. This means there’s no problem you’ll run into that he won’t be able to guide you through. You’ll find he’s selfless, low ego and kind.\\n\\nHere are the cultural reasons we love working at Rise:\\n\\n1. You’ll do work most days that will directly improve people’s lives. Each pixel you move, every word you type, will help more people feel better and be more productive. Each member of the team shares this daily mission. What you do each day directly contributes to the world’s health, happiness, productivity, and longevity. You’ll talk regularly with people whose lives you’ve changed.\\n\\n2. You’ll work with a team where human-centered design is the center of how we develop our product and business. IDEO was our first investor and I did my Master’s in Don Norman’s human-centered design program.\\n\\n3. You’ll collaborate with Jason, who heads design, to continue the work of developing an effective and efficient design system for use across marketing and product. As a design team of two, you’ll shape the practice at Rise Science.\\n\\n4. One of our core values is growth. That means every week; we’ll talk about how we can help you grow. What skills, experiences, people can help you get to your next career goal. For this role to be successful, it has to be a great big step in the right direction for your career, not just a job.\\n\\n5. If entrepreneurship is interesting to you, you’ll also have a front-row seat to all the company building’s ups and downs. Your work will be in front of some of the top consumer health investors and operators that backed and worked at teams at companies like Fitbit and Peloton.\\n\\n6. More than anything else, we realize that life is short. So even though we’re solving an unthinkably large problem, taking time for yourself and your family is essential. Without it, we don’t believe you can live your best life and do your life’s work. And of course, we’ll get your sleep in order. 😉\\n\\nFAQs\\n1. Who will I report to?\\nYou’ll technically report to me. I’ll have hiring and firing decisions.\\nJason is the design functional lead. He’s responsible for coaching you on how to be successful at Rise, evolving our design culture, and if a tie-breaker is needed, making the final call on a conflicting decision.\\n\\n2. Why isn’t Jason hiring for this role since he’s head of design?\\nCompany building is a team sport. Jason has critical product opportunities he’s focused on and my job is maximizing his focus on that. He’ll be playing a key decision role in the interview process and of course someone you’d want to work with.\\n\\n3. What seniority is needed for the role?\\nLanguage around seniority is misleading. So what’s most important is that when you read what would disqualify you, you can point to evidence of how you’d do well in our environment. Years of experience also isn’t a great metric. Jason has been doing this for 23 years. But if you’ve got 5 and you have the talent, this could be a great opportunity.\\n\\n4. What are the career growth paths?\\nIt really depends on what you want which is something I’ll work with you on. When we all do our jobs really well, it creates more opportunity for more talented people to come on board.\\n\\n5. Compensation?\\nWe know great talent deserves to get paid well in cash and equity. We don’t share ranges at this stage because we don’t know what skills you’re coming in with and don’t want to disqualify you depending on your needs. Once we have an idea we’ll share our comp dataset with you so we see the same data. We’re not Facebook or Google but we’re confident that we’ll meet your financial needs.\\n\\n6. Location?\\nUS-friendly hours are strongly preferred. We’re a 100% distributed team (most in Eastern and Central time in the US) and we keep our meetings to an absolute minimum. However, we work semi-synchronously collaborating on zoom so it’s important to have 4+ hours overlap with US eastern time.\\n\\nWhat you’ll need to be successful:\\nExpertise in interaction design: You think in flows, not just static screens. You’ve been making it effortless for people to move around consumer applications for many years. Other designers respect your interaction skills and tap you for advice.\\n\\nExpertise in user-centered design methods: Customer feedback is an inspiration and something you crave to keep your creative juices flowing. You use iterations to maximize your opportunities for feedback. You know what needs to be learned, how to put together a discussion guide, facilitate the session and synthesize the findings.\\n\\nGood visual design fundamentals: Making the right typography choice or reworking a layout to optimize clarity is effortless for you. You know how to apply a style guide effectively but also know when to extend beyond it.\\n\\nCompetent writer: You’ve solved design problems with words and designed with content.\\n\\nSkills and experience that separate you from your peers\\n\\nSeveral years of mobile design experience\\nData visualization chops\\nWorked on products that design for behavior change\\nMotion design experience\\nEffective across a wide range of design tools\\nIf this sounds interesting, let’s talk.\\nInstead of a cover letter, email me at [email\xa0protected] | Subject: ‘Lead Product Designer‘ and include your answers to the questions below. We appreciate thoughtful responses, but please don’t spend more than an hour.\\n\\nTell me why this opportunity feels right to you. What did you respond to in the letter?\\n\\nThink about your current or last job. When it’s time for me to talk with your boss what would they rate your performance 1-10? Why? What were you hired to do?\\n\\nWe’d love to understand the relevant work you’ve done. If you have a tidy portfolio, feel free to send the link/pdf it will help us speed things up. If you don’t have a portfolio, you’ll need to get creative. \\n\\nWhat can you send us that would give us confidence you’ve got the relevant skills? We’ll be going deep on your work in our 2nd conversation so don’t spend too much time here.\\n\\nWhat to expect Next\\nI’ll hand review what you send. I’ll respond with either “I don’t think the fit is here” or that we should move forward with the process. If we move forward, here’s the rest of the process we’ll use to learn together if this is an amazing fit for you:\\n\\n1. 45 min Interview: We meet over Zoom to meet each other and decide if spending more time together makes sense. Your time is valuable and we don’t want to waste it.\\n\\n2. 60 mins Work Review: You’ve read the job letter and what we need you to do. During this conversation I’ll ask you to walk through, in detail, how you’ve done this in a past job. I may invite a few team members to join.\\n\\n3. Paid Work Simulation: We’ll send over a take-home challenge that will let us simulate working together. This is designed to be similar to the type of work we do here at Rise Science. This stage should take no more than 3 hours, and we’ll both have a clear sense of how we work together by the end.\\n\\n4. Team Talks: At this stage we’re incredibly confident that the role will be great for you. Get to know the team you’d be working with. You’ll find time with 1-4 of your potential future team members. \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **DARING** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Companies can search these words to find applicants that read this and see they're human.\\n\\n \\n\\n#Salary and compensation\\n\n$120,000 — $220,000/year\\n\n\\n\\n#Location\\nUnited States, Canada\n\n\n\n\nSee more jobs at Rise Science\n\n\nVisit Rise Science's website""]",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK

But obesity treatment is radically changing due to a new wave of medication options which are 2-3x more effective than previous options. In addition, only 10% of those using weight management services are men: all programs market to women, not tackling the stigma men feel around this.\\n\\nFella\'s founders are [Luke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-harries) & [Richie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-cartwright). We studied together at Cambridge University.\\n\\n- Luke\xa0studied pre-med and developed a patented AI approach to detecting cancer\xa0at a YC bio company, before moving to Microsoft Research. He also has a masters in Computer Science.\\n- Richie was a data scientist, building and selling an AI company working with the UK government.

With our Head of Growth, you’ll decide which experiments to run (e.g. whether to call drop-offs immediately, whether to use FB lead ads) and how best to prioritize leads. You’ll own both ‘opening’ and ‘closing’ the fella, building trust on a delicate healthcare subject.\\n- *Handle inbound*: You’ll own all inbound from potential fellas. You’ll be comfortable closing fellas who have booked calls from our email sequences, and you’ll stay on top of all inbound messages from fellas: replies to our email/SMS sequences, replies to our FB ads, pre-conversion messages on our website.\\n- *Nurture your pipeline*: You’ll own your sales pipeline. You’ll follow-up diligently after calls, loop round on SMS to fellas who haven’t yet closed, and handle customer objections gracefully. You’ll tightly prioritize across your pipeline.\\n- *Create the playbook*: You’ll furiously iterate the sales process, then build out the playbook so we can build out the team. You’ll routinely analyze call recordings to determine what is going well and what you can improve. You’ll review prioritization of leads, iterate your sales scripts, and reconsider value props. Once you’re happy with the process, you’ll ensure this playbook is ready for building out the team around you.\\n- *Transfer your learnings*: You’ll be spending lots of time with potential fellas, so you’ll have great customer insights you’ll transfer to our Head of Growth & founders.

You’ll ask good questions, listen carefully and build trust.\\n - *Resilience*: sales isn’t easy.

You’re comfortable transitioning between different techniques based on the customer type & objection.\\n - *Closing*: you know when and how to turn a potential fella into a paying fella, moving quickly but carefully. You’ll know when to prioritize a lead and when to let them go.\\n - *Language*: you speak English fluently.\\n\\nCultural skills\\n - *End-to-end ownership* — you are comfortable owning projects from noticing the problem to delivering the outcome.\\n - *Commitment to candor* — we believe in open communication and transparency. You are a clear & caring communicator, welcoming feedback.\\n - *Belief in the mission* — we will help 1 million fellas by 2026. We have a lot of work to do, and you are dedicated to the mission.\\n - *Do what is needed* — speed is critical, things change suddenly, and often the solutions we need are messy.

Your team-members help you flourish, but the eventual responsibility lies with you.\\n - *Seeing systems* — you recognize the system which produces the outcome, and focus on improving the system to fix the true cause of an issue.\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n- *Compensation*: great salary + early-stage equity\\n- Vacation: unlimited PTO with a yearly minimum\\n- *Pension*: 401(k) contributions\\n- *Healthcare*: high-quality medical insurance\\n- *Family*: paid parental leave\\n- *Personal development*: budget for books, courses, coaching\\n- *Personal wellness*: budget for gym, health apps\\n- *Team*: regular off-sites\\n-\xa0**What are we missing?**\xa0We\'re still early so you get to shape our culture. \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **GRACEFUL** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

We are fully remote, with overlapping ‘office hours’ during the mornings (GMT). \\n\\nWe are strong believers in giving everyone the autonomy to do their best work, when and how they prefer. That means you’ll have a lot of flexibility and control over how to shape your job and work life, while getting all the support you need to succeed.\\n\\nWe take our health and mental health seriously, believing that we can only perform to our best when we are healthy and happy. That’s why we work 4.5 day weeks, with a flexible half day that you can use as you choose. \\n\\nYou can learn more about the team and what it’s like working at Sona [here](https://www.notion.so/getsona/Working-at-Sona-4e3c00206c414d8c9eb9b7a617cdc6d7)\\n\\n### About the role\\nWe fundamentally believe that the best products are built when small, cross functional, autonomous teams are empowered to solve business problems as they see fit. You’ll be joining a pod which owns a particular area of the product and movement between product areas is encouraged and easy.\\n\\nEngineers are heavily involved throughout the product development process, inputting into the why and what as well as the how.\\n\\n*Our stack has two main components:*\\n* A backend with a GraphQL API (for communicating with the Native App) and a web frontend built using Elixir and Phoenix Live View (the PETAL stack)\\n* A native mobile application built in React Native + Typescript\\n\\nWe think in terms of “T Shaped” developers. This means that while all of us have some ability across the “full stack”, most of us have one side of the stack (e.g. Elixir or React Native) we’re stronger on and spend the bulk of our time on.\\n\\nWe’re passionate advocates of the Live View approach for building web applications and believe that it’s one of the biggest step changes in productivity and developer experience since Ruby on Rails.\\n\\nLikewise we strongly believe in the benefits of the common, typesafe Android and iOS codebase that React Native combined with Typescript and GraphQL gives us. \\n\\nTypically when somebody starts working with us, they have strong experience with one side of the stack and then learn the other part on the job.\\n\\n### How We Work\\nOur [engineering principles](https://www.notion.so/getsona/Engineering-Team-Principles-b83ffe9620a645e5920529ad79928c66)give a flavour of how we like to work. We’re a fully remote team spread across 4 countries (and growing). We have a company stand up most mornings at 10:00 UK time. We aim to have fully paid for company meetups roughly once per quarter.\\n\\nEverything starts with talking to customers. We like everyone in the company to regularly join either sales calls with new prospects or catch ups with existing customers\\n\\nWe’re a small company with a strong preference for lightweight, asynchronous processes. \\n\\nWithin product we work in sprints with periodic retrospectives.\\n\\n### Interview Process\\nOur hiring process follows this pattern:\\n* Initial phone screen (30 minutes) focused primarily on approach to work, career goals and your questions about Sona\\n* Technical Interview (1-2 hours) take us through a piece of code you're proud of and talk about how it's architected, what worked well and what you'd do differently if you wrote it again. If you don't have a suitable piece of code, we're also happy to pay you for half a days work to do a take home task. But we understand that everyone's busy so we'd much rather use some code you've already got where possible!\\n* Founder Interview (1 hour), focused on why you’re interested in Sona and your questions about the vision\\n\\n### Requirements\\nWe love engineers who have a non nonsense approach to “getting it shipped”, who when given the choice between “complicated and shiny” vs “get something simple in front of a user” will always choose the latter.\\n\\nEverybody’s different, but a lot of the following probably applies to you:\\n* You have extensive professional experience in either React Native or Elixir\\n* If your experience is in React Native you’re happy to talk about Typescript, the role of generics and when they should be used, how hooks changed how we build React Native apps and when one should consider writing custom hooks. You’d be equally happy explaining promises and how they interact with async / await.\\n* If your experience is in Elixir you’re passionate about LiveView and are comfortable talking about it’s advantages and challenges\\n* You have a strong preference towards taking ownership, making sure you’re clear on what you’re doing and why and then communicating progress over awaiting instruction\\n* You’re in a country which is GMT +/- 3 and fluent communicating both verbally and in writing in English\\n\\n### Benefits\\n* Competitive salary\\n* 4.5 day standard working week\\n* 37 days annual leave (25 days standard plus 12 flexible ‘bank holiday’ days)\\n* Share options\\n* Fully remote and flexible working\\n* Co-working space stipend\\n* Free mental health support (On-demand online therapy & coaching)\\n* Quarterly all expenses paid team retreats\\n* The latest Macbook and equipment for your home office\\n* Professional development budget\\n* Unlimited free books \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **AWE** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Thus we still run a moderate cloud stack on the Google Cloud Platform. As you can see in the description of our stack, we use Hashicorp\'s tools for deployment.

Most of the work is in improving the experience of other developers, and making it easier for them to do the things they need to do on the operations side.\\n\\nFor example, we use Terraform to control and set up our resources. However that doesn\'t mean that it is clear for everyone what to use and how to tie that together. Modularizing and documenting is key here. Also, we want to enable continuous integration here, so everyone can see what the effect would be of their changes, without giving everyone the necessary credentials to the whole stack.\\n\\nThe rest of the team will look to you for advice on how to deploy their service, how to keep sight on its metrics and errors.

We are looking for someone who is eager to improve, not too shy to ask any type of question and who can communicate well in writing.

Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\\n\\nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\\n\\n**--Is this a real job ad?--**\\n\\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 80ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.\\n\\nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):\\n\\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\\n\\nAnd check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.\\n\\n**--What do you guys do?--**\\n\\nOur business involves taking random products and then marketing the heck out of them, primarily on Amazon. We have hundreds of SKUs at the moment and are launching around 10-20 new products every single month. A small sampling:\\n\\n- Bad Parking Cards (http://amzn.com/B01HLGZRCQ)\\n- Cable Tie Mounts (http://amzn.com/B06XNBS6TG)\\n- K2-D3 Capsules (http://amzn.com/B07C451MZ9)\\n\\nWe want to launch as many products as we can. Our business is growing rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\\n\\n**--What is your company like?--**\\n\\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.\\n\\n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\\n\\n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\\n\\n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.\\n\\n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\\n\\n6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.\\n\\n7. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.\\n\\n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\\n\\n9. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\\n\\n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\\n\\n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\\n\\n**--What are your company’s values?--**\\n\\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\\n\\nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.\\n\\n**--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--**\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n**--Wait. What?--**\\n\\nOK fine.\\n\\n**--So, what will I actually be doing?--**\\n\\nSuper short version:\\n\\nWe basically don’t have a marketing department, which I’m sure you’ll agree is pretty silly for a $16m E-Commerce company. We have a lot of pretty cool products, and more on the way, and we need you to put these products in front of the right audience, so that we can sell more of them!\\n\\nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\\n\\n- Figure out what marketing channels we should be selling through\\n- Prove that we can profitably sell through those channels\\n- Build systems so that you aren’t the one doing the day-to-day operation of those channels\\n- Build a team of marketers to scale to do the same/similar process on all of our existing catalogs and the new products in the pipeline\\n- Scale your department as the company scales\\n\\nThis is effectively building a marketing department from scratch, which has a lot of pros but also cons. If you want the freedom to build as you see fit, this is the position for you.\\n \\nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\\n\\nIt is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.\\n\\n**--Do I need experience?--**\\n\\nYes. This is not an entry level position. You are going to de-facto be an executive in the company and need to have relevant experience doing this and managing people.\\n\\n**--Do I need a college degree?--**\\n\\nYou just need to be awesome.\\n\\n**--What marketing do you currently do?--**\\n\\nWe just throw things onto Amazon with PPC and hope for the best. It’s worked OK to this point, but we could be 2-3x bigger with proper marketing.\\n\\n**--Is there a team in place?--**\\n\\nWe have some junior marketers who are sorta/kinda doing stuff, but nothing serious. Mostly light activities on Amazon.\\n\\n**--Do you have budget?--**\\n\\nYes, within reason. We’re definitely not gonna be doing a Superbowl ad anytime soon, but I also fully intend to spend money to make this work.\\n\\n**--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--**\\n\\nHaha - you sound just like my parole officer!\\n\\n**--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--**\\n\\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\\n\\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/oHp1wmmdNH/Marketing-Director-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\\n\\nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\\n\\nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\\n\\nOnce you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\\n\\nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\\n\\n----\\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Quality Assurance Developer Engineer With PHP JavaScript and SQL,Defiant,💰 $90k - $120k,🌏 Worldwide,2022-01-10T17:55:20+00:00,https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs/107238-remote-qa-dev-engineer-with-php-js-and-sql-defiant,"[""Defiant \n\n\n\ndefiant.com \n\n\nApply now\n\n\n🔎3,692 views\n\n\n✅ 858 applied\n(23%)\n\n\n\nDefiant is hiring a Remote Quality Assurance Developer Engineer With PHP JavaScript and SQL \n## Description\\nDefiant is hiring a QADev Engineer. Please note that this is not an automation role. We are hiring QA Analysts that have the ability to program in PHP and Javascript, and have a strong interest not just in finding bugs, but looking at code to determine why they exist, and occasionally dropping in a quick fix to continue testing.\\n\\nThe salary range for this role is $90,000 to $120,000 with full benefits. It includes a no-strings-attached $15,000 dollar hiring bonus on your first paycheck. We are confident you’ll love working at Defiant and being a part of our amazing team, and our signing bonus reflects that.\\n\\nAt Defiant, we have broken down the traditional wall that exists between Dev and QA. Our QA team is more technical than most and spends time not just finding, reproducing, and logging bugs, but actually diagnosing the underlying cause and providing an unusual amount of detail to our dev team to help them quickly implement a fix.\\n\\nFor this role, you need to be able to read and write PHP and Javascript code along with SQL. Our hiring process will include a technical portion that will evaluate your ability to not only find and report bugs but to determine what the underlying cause of a bug is.\\n\\nIf you are currently in a QA role that is not as technical as you’d like, and you want to get your hands dirty looking at PHP and JS code, tracing execution, diving into the database, and diagnosing the underlying cause of an issue, then this role may be perfect for you.\\n\\nMuch like the DevOps role broke down the wall between the operations team and the development team, we have broken down the wall between QA and Dev by creating a role that we are calling “QADev”.\\n\\nThis job is 100% remote. You can work from anywhere as long as you have bandwidth. We do most of our calls voice only, and we also use push-to-talk so you can operate in noisy environments like a coffee shop, while traveling, or with kids around.\\n\\nWe are looking for individuals who don’t just do the minimum. Our team tries harder, goes further, digs deeper, pushes technology beyond its customary boundaries. WordPress powers 40% of the web, and we are the leaders in WordPress security. Compromise or complacency is not an option for us.\\n\\nOur core hours are from 10am – 1pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. In general, we want our team to be available during that time, but we’re a realistic company, we understand that life happens, and we’re outcome-focused. So as long as you’re doing a great job and getting things done, we are flexible.\\n\\n\\n## Requirements\\nAt Defiant we have one core value, and that is “Trust”. We trust that you’ll do a great job working remotely, be available during our core hours, and once you run out of work, find other ways to contribute. We don’t micro-manage and we don’t continuously monitor our team or their productivity. If you love QA, are passionate about your job, are productive, and can help the team ship great software, you’ll be very successful at Defiant.\\n\\nThe specific skills we require for this position are:\\n\\n* Experience testing complex web applications is required.\\n* Experience testing LAMP applications is preferred.\\n* Mid-level PHP programming ability and use of dev tools required.\\n* Mid-level Javascript programming ability and use of dev tools is required.\\n* Experience working with a bug tracking system like Fogbugz, JIRA, or similar is required.\\n* SQL knowledge is required.\\n* AWS experience is preferred.\\n* A passion for testing applications and shipping robust software is a must. This is a quality assurance role, not a developer role.\\n\\n\\n## Hiring Process\\n\\nAll positions require a trial period of approximately 3 weeks with a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week. You will be paid for this short-term contract, and it will be used to evaluate whether both parties want to pursue an ongoing, regular employment relationship.\\n\\nAll offers of employment are contingent on the successful completion of a background check. The results of the background check are considered as they relate to the position and do not automatically disqualify someone from an offer of employment with the company.\\n\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n* $15,000 one time hiring bonus.\\n* Full time telecommuting and flexible working hours, with a company that has been 100% remote for over 8 years.\\n* 100% employee premium and 50% of dependent premium paid by company for premier- level medical, dental, and vision insurance.\\n* 21 days PTO per year to start.\\n* Approximately 12 paid company holidays including the week from December 25 to January 1.\\n* 401(k) with a 4% Safe Harbor company match that is 100% vested immediately.\\n* Latest in laptop and workstation technology.\\n* Wellness reimbursement program for health and fitness purchases.\\n* Mobile phone and internet reimbursement up to $100 per month.\\n* Monthly beverage reimbursement for coffee, tea, water, etc.\\n* Paid training and study time for work-related training and certifications.\\n* College tuition and Student Loan reimbursement.\\n\\n\\n## Diversity at Defiant\\n\\nWe value diversity and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, gender identity or expression, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, economic status, parental status, or any other non-performance-related status. \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **SOFT** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

We’ve made a strong case for how and why audiences and society benefit when solutions journalism is integrated into the news — and we’ve had real success. We’ve worked with over 600 news organizations and 25,000 individual journalists and, based on growing demand for our work, currently staff are working across the United States as well as in Africa and Europe. Around the world, solutions reporting is being adopted by news organizations because it increases audience trust and engagement, sharpens accountability and can open up new sources of revenue.\xa0\\n\\nToday we believe it is more urgent than ever that we take bold action and significantly broaden our reach. Building on our foundational work with newsrooms, we are embarking upon an ambitious new strategy aimed at advancing a system-level change across the field of journalism, in which strong communications will play a critical role. Working with a core group of journalists, educators and allies, we aim to engage tens of thousands more along with hundreds of news organizations in a movement to ensure ready access to news that is informed by solutions reporting. Our vision of success is sweeping but achievable. With broad adoption of solutions journalism, we envision an increase in society’s capacity to solve problems, widespread reach of more complete and accurate coverage, advances in fairness and equity in reporting and a public that is actively involved in the stories being told about their communities.\xa0\xa0\\n\\nAs solutions journalism leads a systems-level change in the media landscape, we are looking for a Media Researcher to deliver an in-depth report including recommendations on how we can leverage key partners, platforms, and innovations to disseminate effective responses towards social problems to a larger and more diverse group of people.\xa0We are looking for someone who has a familiarity with and/or previous experience conducting media landscapes or other kinds of media research, as well as a pulse on the new media scene, ideally with connections to and knowledge of what’s working (and why) and best practices\xa0The researcher will conduct a digital media analysis in order to identify patterns and recommendations for viable media platforms and innovations to scale solutions journalism, with an eye for reaching underserved audiences. The report will include an analysis of the landscape, visuals representing mapping of key players, and defining characteristics of each individual/ partner/ tool based on criteria to be developed in collaboration with the director of communications.\\n\\nDo you have skills or experiences that we haven’t thought of that you can bring to this job? Tell us how you can see this role benefit from your own individual experiences. We’re an energetic, ambitious, and fun bunch, and we want great people to join us. \\n\\nEquity, Justice, Diversity and Inclusion at SJN means a workplace where individual differences are recognized, appreciated, respected and responded to in ways that fully develop and utilize each person’s talents and strengths. Diversity of perspective, identity, and experience is important to us.\xa0 We want to reflect and serve the whole of society. As a result, we encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds to seek employment, and we make all employment decisions without regard to race, age, gender, sexual orientation, or any other factors protected by federal, state or local law. To request reasonable accommodation, contact Eva Blanc, [email\xa0protected]\\n\\n\\nSJN Application & Hiring Process FAQ\\n\\nQ: Where’s the best place to learn more about the Solutions Journalism Network and the work that you do?\\nA: Start with this “brief but spectacular” video made for PBS and featuring David Bornstein, one of SJN’s co-founders. Check out the SJN website, new research on how audiences respond to solutions journalism, our most recent survey of our newsroom partners and this study on how solutions journalism can lead to increased revenue.\xa0\\n\\nQ: Where do I submit my cover letter?\\nA: The SJN application does not include a cover letter. Instead, we ask a series of questions that we hope will provide the opportunity for you to share your thoughts. All applicants respond to the same questions, which removes the guesswork of a cover letter and enables you to focus on the things we’re most interested in knowing about your qualifications for this role. (note: after the application questions, you will see a final box that says ""ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"" and the preview text says ""add a cover letter or anything else you want to share”. Please do not upload a cover letter here. If you have additional information that you would like to share with us that you didn’t include in your application responses you can use this space to do so.\xa0\\n\\nQ: The job description says this position is remote does that mean I can work from home?\\nA: Yes. This position can be done from anywhere in the United States. The Solutions Journalism Network has its office in New York City (when we get back to the office!), but about half of our staff are based elsewhere. We would love for this position to join us in our office when we return.\\n\\nQ: Under benefits in the job description you mention a technology stipend. How does that work?\\nA: SJN staffers provide their own cell phones, laptops and other technology. To help cover the cost, SJN provides each staffer with an annual stipend.\\n\\nQ: What happens after I submit my application?\\nA: Once the application period closes, a team of SJN staffers will review all of the applications and contact candidates who move to the next stage of the process, which will include 1-2 rounds of interviews and, possibly, an additional (brief) assignment. \\n\\n#Location\\nNew York, NY\n\n\n\n\nSee more jobs at Solutions Journalism Network']",https://remoteok.com,REMOTEOK
