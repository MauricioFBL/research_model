Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is.\\n\\nWe are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me.\\n\\n**--Is this a real job ad?--**\\n\\nYup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 80ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people.\\n\\nOur careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal):\\n\\nhttp://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\\n\\nAnd check out our reviews on Google, Glassdoor, or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool.\\n\\n**--What do you guys do?--**\\n\\nOur business involves taking random products and then marketing the heck out of them, primarily on Amazon. We have hundreds of SKUs at the moment and are launching around 10-20 new products every single month. A small sampling:\\n\\n- Bad Parking Cards (http://amzn.com/B01HLGZRCQ)\\n- Cable Tie Mounts (http://amzn.com/B06XNBS6TG)\\n- K2-D3 Capsules (http://amzn.com/B07C451MZ9)\\n\\nWe want to launch as many products as we can. Our business is growing rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.\\n\\n**--What is your company like?--**\\n\\n1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers.\\n\\n2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.\\n\\n3. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it.\\n\\n4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done.\\n\\n5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.\\n\\n6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.\\n\\n7. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.\\n\\n8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?\\n\\n9. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.\\n\\n10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.\\n\\n11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.\\n\\n**--What are your company’s values?--**\\n\\nSee here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/\\n\\nYes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.\\n\\n**--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--**\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n**--Wait. What?--**\\n\\nOK fine.\\n\\n**--So, what will I actually be doing?--**\\n\\nSuper short version:\\n\\nWe basically don’t have a marketing department, which I’m sure you’ll agree is pretty silly for a $16m E-Commerce company. We have a lot of pretty cool products, and more on the way, and we need you to put these products in front of the right audience, so that we can sell more of them!\\n\\nHere is a bulleted list of responsibilities:\\n\\n- Figure out what marketing channels we should be selling through\\n- Prove that we can profitably sell through those channels\\n- Build systems so that you aren’t the one doing the day-to-day operation of those channels\\n- Build a team of marketers to scale to do the same/similar process on all of our existing catalogs and the new products in the pipeline\\n- Scale your department as the company scales\\n\\nThis is effectively building a marketing department from scratch, which has a lot of pros but also cons. If you want the freedom to build as you see fit, this is the position for you.\\n \\nLike everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed.\\n\\nIt is challenging, but fun work that’s going to require a lot of time and task management, problem-solving, and a reasonable amount of people skills.\\n\\n**--Do I need experience?--**\\n\\nYes. This is not an entry level position. You are going to de-facto be an executive in the company and need to have relevant experience doing this and managing people.\\n\\n**--Do I need a college degree?--**\\n\\nYou just need to be awesome.\\n\\n**--What marketing do you currently do?--**\\n\\nWe just throw things onto Amazon with PPC and hope for the best. It’s worked OK to this point, but we could be 2-3x bigger with proper marketing.\\n\\n**--Is there a team in place?--**\\n\\nWe have some junior marketers who are sorta/kinda doing stuff, but nothing serious. Mostly light activities on Amazon.\\n\\n**--Do you have budget?--**\\n\\nYes, within reason. We’re definitely not gonna be doing a Superbowl ad anytime soon, but I also fully intend to spend money to make this work.\\n\\n**--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--**\\n\\nHaha - you sound just like my parole officer!\\n\\n**--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--**\\n\\nPlease submit your information on the following page to apply:\\n\\nhttps://jlstradingco.applytojob.com/apply/oHp1wmmdNH/Marketing-Director-Fun-Ecom-Co-Great-People-Flexible-Hours\\n\\nWe promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.\\n\\nThere will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.\\n\\nOnce you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).\\n\\nThank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\\n\\n----\\nJLS Trading Co. provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Please note that this is not an automation role. We are hiring QA Analysts that have the ability to program in PHP and Javascript, and have a strong interest not just in finding bugs, but looking at code to determine why they exist, and occasionally dropping in a quick fix to continue testing.\\n\\nThe salary range for this role is $90,000 to $120,000 with full benefits. It includes a no-strings-attached $15,000 dollar hiring bonus on your first paycheck. We are confident you’ll love working at Defiant and being a part of our amazing team, and our signing bonus reflects that.\\n\\nAt Defiant, we have broken down the traditional wall that exists between Dev and QA. Our QA team is more technical than most and spends time not just finding, reproducing, and logging bugs, but actually diagnosing the underlying cause and providing an unusual amount of detail to our dev team to help them quickly implement a fix.\\n\\nFor this role, you need to be able to read and write PHP and Javascript code along with SQL. Our hiring process will include a technical portion that will evaluate your ability to not only find and report bugs but to determine what the underlying cause of a bug is.\\n\\nIf you are currently in a QA role that is not as technical as you’d like, and you want to get your hands dirty looking at PHP and JS code, tracing execution, diving into the database, and diagnosing the underlying cause of an issue, then this role may be perfect for you.\\n\\nMuch like the DevOps role broke down the wall between the operations team and the development team, we have broken down the wall between QA and Dev by creating a role that we are calling “QADev”.\\n\\nThis job is 100% remote. You can work from anywhere as long as you have bandwidth. We do most of our calls voice only, and we also use push-to-talk so you can operate in noisy environments like a coffee shop, while traveling, or with kids around.\\n\\nWe are looking for individuals who don’t just do the minimum. Our team tries harder, goes further, digs deeper, pushes technology beyond its customary boundaries. WordPress powers 40% of the web, and we are the leaders in WordPress security. Compromise or complacency is not an option for us.\\n\\nOur core hours are from 10am – 1pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. In general, we want our team to be available during that time, but we’re a realistic company, we understand that life happens, and we’re outcome-focused. So as long as you’re doing a great job and getting things done, we are flexible.\\n\\n\\n## Requirements\\nAt Defiant we have one core value, and that is “Trust”. We trust that you’ll do a great job working remotely, be available during our core hours, and once you run out of work, find other ways to contribute. We don’t micro-manage and we don’t continuously monitor our team or their productivity. If you love QA, are passionate about your job, are productive, and can help the team ship great software, you’ll be very successful at Defiant.\\n\\nThe specific skills we require for this position are:\\n\\n* Experience testing complex web applications is required.\\n* Experience testing LAMP applications is preferred.\\n* Mid-level PHP programming ability and use of dev tools required.\\n* Mid-level Javascript programming ability and use of dev tools is required.\\n* Experience working with a bug tracking system like Fogbugz, JIRA, or similar is required.\\n* SQL knowledge is required.\\n* AWS experience is preferred.\\n* A passion for testing applications and shipping robust software is a must. This is a quality assurance role, not a developer role.\\n\\n\\n## Hiring Process\\n\\nAll positions require a trial period of approximately 3 weeks with a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week. You will be paid for this short-term contract, and it will be used to evaluate whether both parties want to pursue an ongoing, regular employment relationship.\\n\\nAll offers of employment are contingent on the successful completion of a background check. The results of the background check are considered as they relate to the position and do not automatically disqualify someone from an offer of employment with the company.\\n\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n* $15,000 one time hiring bonus.\\n* Full time telecommuting and flexible working hours, with a company that has been 100% remote for over 8 years.\\n* 100% employee premium and 50% of dependent premium paid by company for premier- level medical, dental, and vision insurance.\\n* 21 days PTO per year to start.\\n* Approximately 12 paid company holidays including the week from December 25 to January 1.\\n* 401(k) with a 4% Safe Harbor company match that is 100% vested immediately.\\n* Latest in laptop and workstation technology.\\n* Wellness reimbursement program for health and fitness purchases.\\n* Mobile phone and internet reimbursement up to $100 per month.\\n* Monthly beverage reimbursement for coffee, tea, water, etc.\\n* Paid training and study time for work-related training and certifications.\\n* College tuition and Student Loan reimbursement.\\n\\n\\n## Diversity at Defiant\\n\\nWe value diversity and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental disability, military or veteran status, gender identity or expression, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, economic status, parental status, or any other non-performance-related status. \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **SOFT** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Our clients include CARE International, QURE Healthcare, San Francisco Mayor's Office of Housing, and Hopelab.\\n\\nExygy has embraced a work from home philosophy and we are now a remote-first company. This role can be located anywhere in the U.S and may occasionally require traveling to the San Francisco Bay Area for meetings or team building events. Exygy remains connected and engaged with virtual team events, weekly all hands meetings and regular zoom workshops and trainings.\\n\\nSummary\\nProduct Managers at Exygy are focused on the planning and execution of successful product strategy, design, and engineering projects for our clients.

We expect that the person in this role may lead our project team in implementing the housing product across multiple counties/cities.\\n\xa0\\nYou thrive in extracting key motivations and requirements across team members and stakeholders in order to create and prioritize solutions that solve user problems. Your focus on high standards will help you execute Agile processes to support delivery from kickoff, launch, and through product growth. Your communication and creative problem solving will help anticipate blockers and navigate the day-to-day while your understanding of digital products will help you advocate for high-quality strategy, design, and engineering work. Your ability to balance multiple, dynamic projects that range in size will help our team maximize capacity. Finally, your leadership and people skills coupled with your facility with details will help guide projects to success.\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEEO & Commitment to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion\\nWe are actively seeking to create a diverse and equitable work environment because we believe that creates a stronger team. \\n\\nExygy values a diverse workplace and strongly encourages women, people of color, LGBTQIA individuals, people with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, older members of society, and others from minority groups and diverse backgrounds to apply.

Your phone communication needs to be spot-on and you have to be comfortable making those calls to get all the information we need from the buyer and seller.\\n\\n**What's the Lifestyle Like?**\\n \\n\\nOur company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits!\\n\\n\\nWe aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. You’ll be free to work anywhere that serves your lifestyle best\xa0**(see USA resident requirements below)**. \\n\\n\\nWhile we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company.

We help our customers build, document, automate, and track recurring workflows. Our platform stores knowledge where the action happens, ensuring thorough and error free execution of workflows that our global customers run their businesses on. \\n\\nWe service over 3k customers around the world, such as Airbnb, Spotify. AstraZeneca and Accenture, and are VC-backed by Accel, Salesforce, and Atlassian.\\n\\nProcess Street was founded on a strong belief in the work-life benefits of a healthy, collaborative remote culture. We value flexibility because many of us are parents, travelers, or just creatives who aren't inspired by the construct of a mundane 9-to-5. Spread across 9 different time zones, we communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take real ownership of our work. \\n\\nIf you’re entrepreneurial and seek an environment that values your effective creativity, congratulations, you’ve found your new home!\\n\\n \\n\\nAbout You\\n\\n* You want agency. We practice the Shape Up process, and run 6-week cycles and 2-week cooldowns. For the 6-week cycles, PMs provide a problem statement and some guidelines – no tickets, no detailed specs, no hi-fidelity solutions, and no estimates. Designers and engineers are trusted to craft the best solution possible in the cycle using user research, data, experience, and grit. During the 2-week cooldowns, you have the autonomy to work on what's important to you – including code maintainability or making the team faster. If a lot of responsibility, freedom, and ambiguity sounds refreshing, this role is for you.\\n* You're well-versed in JavaScript and React. Process Street is built on AngularJS, React, React Query, Redux, and Chakra UI. If you've hand-rolled JS micro-frontends or led the architecture of large React applications, you're an ideal candidate for this role.\\n* You love to ship. We move fast. We deploy continuously behind feature flags, and release to customers at the end of every cycle. We utilize CI/CD and maintain ~70% test coverage.\\n* You love process, but loathe meetings, bureaucracy, and ceremony. We think process is a tool. Used well, it makes us a better, faster team. But when it's not doing that, we drop it. We avoid unnecessary meetings whenever possible. A typical week for our engineers and designers has fewer than 5 hours of meetings.\\n* You want to have a big impact. We're a small team and we're still early stage. We don't have designated areas of responsibility, and everyone wears the product hat. Every cycle brings new challenges, and your sphere of influence is wide. You love the variety and don't want to be shackled to a single project for years.\\n* You have seven (7) or more years of experience in software development. We will hire in a range of levels for this position. So if the role excites you, and you have seven years of experience, but don't have the exact title listed here, you should apply.\\n \\n\\nOur Benefits\\n\\n* Fully remote team – No offices, no commute, check-in from a destination of your choosing!\\n* Unlimited PTO policy – Most take 3-4 weeks, plus their major holidays, AND a company-wide week off in December\\n* Annual company offsite* (when not in a pandemic of course) In lieu of an offsite, we do encourage and sponsor small group meetups so that you can meet your teammates face to face around the world.\\n* Social time – We know human connections are what make teams strong. We regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, house tours (only if you're comfortable), and more to build connections.\\n* Generous health insurance for US employees and their families\\n* Equity for all full-time roles \\n\\nBe sure to mention the word **FAVORITED** when applying to show you read the job post completely.

Learn more about the product on [https://simplepoll.rocks](https://simplepoll.rocks)\\n- Wilhelm created Simple Poll in early 2016 to improve his own workflow when working in Slack. Started as a side project and then grew up to be a real company!\\n- Simple Poll is one of the most popular apps for Slack and over the course of a year serves millions of users. As a member of the engineering team, you will be able to directly impact the experience of all of those users.\\n- We are a fairly early stage company with a small and growing team. We\'re profitable, bootstrapped (no external investment) and very much plan to stay that way!\\n\\nBecause we’re such a small team, you will be able to have a massive impact. Not just on Simple Poll the product and its millions of users but also on the company, our culture, and our day to day collaboration. \\n\\nFrom an engineering perspective Simple Poll can often feel similar to building an API. Slack apps work largely by receiving JSON payloads from Slack, making API calls to the Slack API, and then returning some JSON back to Slack. As such, our engineering work tends to be very backend-heavy and although we do have a web dashboard, writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is more rare.\\n\\nIn our day to day work we face an interesting set of evolving engineering and product challenges:\\n\\n- One such challenge is dealing creatively with the constraints of the Slack platform. Since Simple Poll exists almost entirely within Slack, we are bound by many of the constraints and extension capabilities of the Slack platform, such as the block kit framework ([https://api.slack.com/block-kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit)). A powerful set of tools is available to us, but the path to bringing a feature to life is sometimes not as straightforward as it seems.\\n- We also constantly face trade offs between making Simple Poll more powerful (and implementing a long list of customer feature requests) while simultaneously maintaining and improving the simplicity that out customers love. Finding a good balance is important here and often we find that there is a way to achieve both capability and simplicity.\\n- Slack is also constantly evolving and it is our responsibility to keep up with this evolution to ensure that Simple Poll works no matter what Slack context users find themselves in. Recent wide-reaching changes have been the introduction of Slack Enterprise Grid (multiple Slack workspace under the same umbrella) and Slack Connect (shared channels between different Slack workspaces). These changes make it more challenging to model Slack entities like users and channels – if you’re curious to learn more about this problem, check out this blog post: [https://wilhelmklopp.com/posts/slack-database-modelling/](https://wilhelmklopp.com/posts/slack-database-modelling/)\\n\\n### Remote\\n\\nWe are remote-first with folks across Canada, the UK, and Germany 🌅\xa0 We love and embrace remote working (and have done so even in pre-pandemic times).

Our small group classes meet over live video chat with teachers who celebrate their unique strengths and empower all learners to develop confidence and a strong sense of self.\\n\\nWe're also focused on removing barriers for historically underserved learners who face systemic challenges to their success. In 2020, we started Outschool.org and began offering financial assistance to families in need.
