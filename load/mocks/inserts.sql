Today, growers don’t have incentive to grow higher-quality crops. In fact, since grain is commoditized, growers’ main incentive is to simply grow as much volume as possible. xa0 Our Marketplace flips the current model on its head by connecting growers directly with buyers and preserving crop identity. This means that growers get paid a premium for growing organic and similarly desirable crops. xa0 Your expertise in interface design and software architecture will help us deliver a world-class application to our growing suite of world-class marketplace products. As a full stack Engineer at Indigo you’ll: Help design and implement performant web applications using a modern web stack consisting of Python, Flask, TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL hosted on AWS Build user-facing features for our suite of applications by implementing React Components in Typescript and integrating with REST APIs Lead features end to end, from technical design to implementation to deployment to production support, communicating risks and issues to stakeholders, and working together to find a path forward Contribute to our internal tools and libraries, looking to leverage shared components, design patterns, and infrastructure wherever possible Ensure that all APIs and applications are adequately tested in an automated framework, including functional and performance tests Review code, have your code reviewed, and learn from other engineers Collaborate with product managers, back-end engineers, and data science engineers to spec, build, test, and deploy high quality code in the cloud About You You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, programming languages,

People on the team find it a safe place to learn and grow. We provide direct feedback to each other regularly (including to your manager) and help each other improve. We have regular coffee breaks on zoom where we chat about the mysteries of the universe. The team owns some of the core workflows in Marketplace around contract checkout and contract negotiations. We handle the critical flow from when a grower accepts a bid on Marketplace to when it actually becomes a contract. We are building most components of this workflow from scratch. About Indigo: We’re building the technology to feed the world and fight climate change. We believe that through teamwork we can achieve more to benefit all of agriculture: from farmers to consumers to the planet. Game changers don´t fit in a box.

Despite the assertion that “data has become the new oil,” the tooling around databases has not meaningfully changed in twenty years. Even with the push for big data and machine learning, a frustrated, growing cadre of data scientists and engineers have to spend too much time setting up and maintaining a basic set up just to use data. bit.io allows users to become immediately productive with data, reducing time from data upload to query to 1 minute. And, our users love it, saying “Your product is amazing”, “really love your product, maybe the best on the market”, and “I am sold on bit.io”. bit.io’s long term vision is to become the place for all the world’s data, private and public, just like github is the place for source code. We’re building a team of passionate dataphiles to make that vision a reality
and make data - especially public data - more accessible to everyone. We’ve got a ton of thorny database, infrastructure, UI, and UX problems to solve along the way. Come build it with us. Critical toward achieving bit.io’s vision is a datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies
data best practices while remaining flexible when opinionated defaults aren’t enough. You will build bit.io’s datastore. ##As a Software Engineer at bit.io you will: * Work across the stack on all aspects of software engineering for the core product * Collaborate directly with all teammates on a small, productive technology team * Solve petabyte-scale problems in the data space * Design, build, test and deploy a complex data management system * Make broad, impactful technology decisions with responsibility for their outcomes ##We’re looking for someone who has: * Shipped product * Experience and passion in data, data engineering, and data processing * Deep knowledge in data management - parsing, cleaning, querying, extracting, etc. * A strong drive to make software easy-to-use ##The ideal backend engineering candidate will have: * Expertise in Python and SQL * Constructed APIs with technology like REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC * Developed with microservices and container technologies like Docker & Kubernetes * High proficiency in building data processing pipelines, working with structured data, and leveraging common database technologies bit.io is an early-stage, well-funded startup that’s fully remote. We’re outcome-oriented, scientific, curious, respectful, resilient, and inclusive. In addition to competitive salary, equity, bonus, and benefits (including top-tier insurance, generous new-parent leave, and unlimited PTO), we do two unique things: (1) in order to be inclusive and to counter systemic hiring inequities, salary and equity is transparent and not negotiated — every employee with the same role and level is paid exactly the same; and, (2) we have 4-day x 8-hour work weeks (i.e., no Fridays) — we value work-life balance and think you’re just as productive. If you’d like to learn more about what we’re building, how we work, and how your career would develop with us, please reach out to email xa0protected ###Additional Information Links: How Our Early-Stage Startup is Offering Fair Equal and Transpaprent Compensation(https://blog.bit.io/how-our-early-stage-startup-is-offering-fair-equal-and-transparent-compensation-ae582a1ad8e4) We Have A 4-Day Work Week and You Should Too(https://blog.bit.io/we-have-a-four-day-work-week-and-you-should-too-795363c6202a) Be sure to mention the word **ADULATION** when applying to show you read the job post completely.
